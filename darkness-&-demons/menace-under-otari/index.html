                <h1>Getting Started</h1>
				  <p>This short adventure for 4-6 2nd level characters is designed to teach new referees and players how to play Darkness &amp; Demons. This page is meant for the referee. If you would rather play a hero, please send this to a friend so that they can run the game. And remember, most importantly, have fun!<br><br>
				  After you have read through this adventure, read or paraphrase the following to the players.<br><br>
				  <i>The small seaside town of Otari is known for its fresh fish and skilled sailors, but above all, it’s a big logging town, providing valuable wood to the nearby metropolis of Absalom. But for you, Otari is home. You grew up playing on the docks, getting lost in the nearby woods, and hearing the fantastical stories of travelers from faraway lands, tales of terrifying dragons and virtuous knights. Such adventure always seemed so distant—until today! Word has begun to spread around Otari that there’s a problem down at the Otari Fishery. Some are saying that some sort of beast is lurking in the basement, feeding on the stores of salted fish. Folks are worried that whatever is eating the fish might get hungry enough to eat the fishers next! You’ve received a letter from Tamily Tanderveil, the owner of the Fishery. Inside is a desperate plea for help. With the town guard busy protecting the loggers, she needs a few brave souls to venture down into the basement of her warehouse and put an end to the beast that’s feasting on her fish! Do you have the courage to face the menace under Otari?</i><br><br>
				  After you finish reading, have the players introduce their heroes to one another, including their name, race, and class. Players might also want to describe what their hero looks like, what kind of gear they carry, and maybe a bit about their personality.</p>
				<h1>Encounter 1: Giant Rats - Dungeon Level 1</h1>
				  <p><i>The stairs leading into the basement of the Otari Fishery creak with age as you make your way downstairs to find the beast that has been eating all the fish. In the center of the room, between stone pillars holding up the fishery overhead, are barrels filled with salted fish. Two of these barrels have been smashed open, spilling their contents on the floor. In the east wall is a large hole, opening into darkness.<br>
				  Just a few hours ago, you gathered with a few other adventurers in Tamily Tanderveil’s office, where she offered you a hundred gold pieces each if you could put an end to this menace. She was thrilled when you agreed to help her with this simple task, but as you make your way downstairs, you can’t help but wonder if this might be a lot more adventure than you bargained for.</i><br><br>
				  Give the players time to do one thing each, and then begin the encounter and have everyone roll initiative. Read or paraphrase the following.<br><br>
				  <i>A strange chittering comes from the hole in the wall. Suddenly, a massive rat the size of a dog emerges from the darkness—and it isn’t alone! The giant rats rush toward you, their huge teeth snapping.</i><br><br>
				  2-8 <strong>rats, giant</strong> appear from the crack in the wall. Each rat has an AC of 7, a movement rate of 12&quot;, and half a hit die.<br><br>
				  Once the rats are defeated, ask the players what the heroes would like to do next. If the heroes return to talk to Tamily, she’s relieved to learn that the rats are dead, but she is certain that rats couldn’t have caused all of the destruction below. The heroes will have to explore further if they want to earn their reward. When the players decide to explore beyond this room, proceed to the next encounter.</p>
				<h1>Encounter 2: Giant Spider - Dungeon Level 1</h1>
				  <p><i>The tunnel continues deeper underground, eventually opening into a large chamber. Patches of glowing blue fungus cling to the ceiling and provide dim light. You can just barely make out vast strands of webbing across the floor and walls of this cavern, stretching between stalactites like shimmering curtains.</i><br><br>
				  Unless the players find a way to avoid the webbing entirely, as soon as any character touches a web, a <strong>spider, giant</strong> emerges from the corner. Unless any character had successfully listened, the spider has the advantage of surprise. The spider has an AC of 5, a move rate of 3&quot; (or 12&quot; on its web), and 4+4 hit dice. In addition, it has deadly venom, meaning that any character which it bites must make a successful save versus poison every turn or take 2-5 hit points of damage.</p>
				<h1>Encounter 3: Undead - Dungeon Level 1</h1>
				  <p><i> After the web-infested cave, the passageway leading deeper underneath the streets of Otari appears to be mostly natural, but someone, or something, has worked to open the cavern and level out the floor, making the passage easily traveled. A crude barricade made from old wooden planks and part of a barrel blocks the entrance to a side tunnel, while the main passage continues off into the gloom.</i><br><br>
				  If the heroes choose to disassemble the barricade quietly, they will have the element of surprise in the coming battle. If they force their way through it, they will have no such advantage. If they choose to ignore the barricade, proceed to the next encounter.<br><br>
				  <i>Beyond the barricade, an old cavern corridor winds down into the earth, ending in an ancient burial vault lit by a strange glowing crystal emitting a blue flame. Alcoves line the walls, each one containing a rotten wooden coffin, while the center of the room has a raised platform holding a stone sarcophagus. As you enter the room, the coffins and the sarcophagus slowly open, and out come several skeletons and an unnaturally large zombie.</i><br><br>
				  This encounter consists of 2-12 <strong>skeletons</strong> and 1 <strong>zombie</strong>. Each skeleton has an AC of 8, a movement rate of 6&quot;, and half a hit die. The zombie, on the other hand, has an AC of 7, a movement rate of 6&quot;, and 1  hit die. The zombie also wears armor and carries a shield.</p>
				<h1>Encounter 4: Greedy Kobolds - Dungeon Level 1</h1>
				  <p><i>This large room looks like it was once a storeroom for a building above. At the far side, you can make out what might have been a cage or cell at some point, but it is now full of crates and barrels. Several lizardlike creatures the size of human children are clustered around the door to the cell, trying to pry it open.</i><br><br>
				  As soon as anyone approaches the 1-10 <strong>kobolds</strong>, the turn around and attack. If the players were stealthy about it, then they will have the element of surprise. Each kobold has an AC of 7, a move rate of 6&quot;, and half a hit die. These kobolds are cowardly and suffer a -1 penalty on all morale checks.<br>
				  Each kobold carries 1-6 gold pieces. In addition, there is treasure type B in the chests in the cell.</p>
				<h1>Encounter 5: Trap - Dungeon Level 1</h1>
				  <p><i> This short hallway has smooth walls of worked stone with a door at either end, though the door at the far end is closed. The floor is tiled with large, square stone tiles.</i><br><br>
				  There is a trap in this hallway. A roll of 2 six-sided dice will determine the type of trap. See <a href="../#tricks-and-traps">the rules on traps</a> for more information.</p>
				<h1>Encounter 6: Kobolds &amp; Traps - Dungeon Level 1</h1>
				  <p><i>The door opens with a creak, revealing a massive chamber that looks like an audience hall. On the far side, a broad set of stairs leads up to where a throne might once have been. Pillars support the high ceiling, and the ruined tatters of once decorative banners still hang from them. A decorative tile pattern centered in the middle of the room shows through the grim coating the floor.</i><br><br>
				  Waiting for the players are 1-6 <strong>kobolds</strong>. There is also a <a href="../#pits">pit</a> <a href="../#tricks-and-traps">trap</a> in the center of the room. See the statistics of kobolds in the Encounter 4 section. Each kobold also carries 1-6 gold pieces.<br><br>
				  After defeating the kobolds, the party can proceed to the second level of the dungeon! It might be wise to return to Otari for a rest first, however. This might also give some characters the oppurtunity to level up.</p>
				<h1>Encounter 7: Kobold Scouts - Dungeon Level 2</h1>
				  <p><i>The stairs spiral down deep into the earth before ending in a chamber that looks like it’s been prepared specifically to defend against intruders. On one side of the room, a table has been turned on its side to provide cover, while on the other, crates and barrels have been piled up to create a second barrier.</i><br><br>
				  The 1-6 <strong>kobold scouts</strong> here are lying in wait and preparing for ambush. The kobolds gain the element of surprise. Each kobold scout has an AC of 7, a movement rate of 6&quot;, 1 hit die, and carries 3-18 gold pieces.</p>
				<h1>Encounter 8: Cinder Rat - Dungeon Level 2</h1>
				  <p><i>Beyond the barricade, the passageway meanders briefly. The floor descends slightly and soon becomes flooded by a shallow pool of water. The water appears to be flowing out of a passageway to the right, and a shimmering blue light in that direction reflects off of the water there. The main passageway continues to the left, over the slight depression in the floor where the water has pooled. An overpowering stench drifts from around a bend.</i><br><br>
				  Here the players can choose in which direction to go. If they continue along the main passage to the left, then proceed to the next encounter. If they instead divert to the right, read or paraphrase the following.<br><br>
				  <i>On the far side of the puddle of water is a strange chamber, crackling with magical energy. Pulsing orbs float in three of the four corners of this room. The orb in the southwest is made of brown earth and stone, whereas the one in the northeast looks to be made of glass, and is filled with a swirling cloud. The orb in the far corner holds a roaring flame; opposite that orb are shattered remains and the water that flows down the passageway to the northwest.</i><br><br>
				  While the heroes might want to learn more about this room, they must first deal with the creature trapped here: a large rat made of pure fire that emerges from the fire orb as soon as the heroes enter. This is a <strong>cinder rat</strong>, which has an AC of 8, a movement rate of 12&quot;, and 3 hit dice. It is immune to fire, but vulnerable to cold, meaning that it will take an additional 3 hit points of damage when taking damage from cold or cold-types. It will also die instantly if it comes into contact with the puddle of water. Any character that comes within 1&quot; of the cinder rat must succeed on a save versus poison or take a -1 penalty to all attack rolls for the next turn because of the toxic smoke that the rat exudes.<br>
				  This is the cinder rat's lair, and as such there is a small hoard of treasure (treasure type B).<br>
				  After the fight with the rat, the heroes can investigate the other two orbs. Any character that touches the <strong>air</strong> orb gains the ability to fly as easily as he can walk for the next hour. Any character that touches the <strong>earth</strong> orb deals double damage on his next attack. Each orb only works once.</p>
				<h1>Encounter 9: Cavemen - Dungeon Level 2</h1>
				  <p><i>There is an overpowering stench in this chamber, like rotten fish mixed with oily sweat. The warm, humid air only adds to the foul atmosphere. Unlike the previous chambers, this one appears to be a natural cavern, dotted with limestone stalactites and stalagmites, making it hard to see where the room ends.</i><br><br>
				  1-6 <strong>cavemen</strong> have taken up residence in this cave, and do not seem to have bathed in several months. They are large but primitive humanoids with an AC of 9, a movement rate of 12&quot;, and 2 hit dice each. They take a -1 penalty on all morale checks and carry no treasure except for a few rotten fish and 2-20 silver pieces each.</p>
				<h1>Encounter 10: A Crud Ton of Kobolds - Dungeon Level 2</h1>
				  <p><i> As the door opens, the smell of rotten fish and mold wafts out. On the west side of this vast room is a large table with benches on either side. Old food scraps, dirty knives, and broken plates cover the table. Off to the east side, burrows have been dug into the wall to make small sleeping chambers filled with straw mats. This must be the kobolds’ warren.</i><br><br>
				  4-24 <strong>kobolds</strong> are in this chamber, eating messily or snoring on the straw mats. The heroes benefit from surprise. See the statistics for kobolds in the Encounter 4 section. Each kobold carries 1-6 gold pieces.<br><br>
				  When only one kobold remains, he immediately drops his weapons and surrenders to the heroes, begging and groveling for his life with a raspy, high-pitched voice and saying that he will tell the players everything that he knows.<br><br>
				  &#8220;<i>Boss Zolgran is the big leader of the mighty kobolds, and she has powerful magics to roast you alive! She’s very angry all the time and demands much  from her servants. Especially now that we have a powerful new friend!</i>&#8221;<br><br>
				  If pressed further, he will also tell the following.<br><br>
				  &#8220;<i>The friend is a dragon and a blessing from the gods, a sign that kobolds are destined to return to the surface and conquer the pathetic human town. As soon as the hatchling is all grown, we’ll rise up to take what is ours!</i>&#8221;</p>
				<h1>Encounter 11: Dragonkeeper - Dungeon Level 2</h1>
				  <p><i>A gaping pit opens in the floor in the center of this large, natural chamber. On the far side, a ledge overlooks the entry. Atop this ledge is an ornate stone throne that looks entirely out of place for this room. A regal kobold wearing an oversized crown made of fish bones sits atop the throne. &#8220;Kill the intruders!&#8221; she snarls at the kobold guards at the foot of the stairs.</i><br><br>
				  Each of the 1-6 <strong>kobold guards</strong> has an AC of 7, a movement rate of 6&quot;, and 1 hit die, and carries 4-24 gold pieces. <strong>Zolgran</strong>, the <strong>kobold queen</strong>, has the same statistics, but 1+1 hit dice and carries 10-60 gold pieces.<br><br>
				  There is also a <a href="../#pits">pit</a> in the center of the room with a <strong>crocodile</strong> at the bottom. The crocodile has an AC of 6, a move rate of 9&quot;, and 3 hit dice. It cannot use its death roll ability because there is no water in the pit.</p>
				<h1>Encounter 12: Dragon - Dungeon Level 2</h1>
				  <p><i> Towering yellow mushrooms cover the floor of this vast cave, some reaching over ten feet in height. They seem to emit a pale light, giving the entire chamber an eerie glow. Shattered remnants of barrels—torn open with their contents nowhere to be seen—lay scattered around the base of the mushrooms. Somewhere off on the far side of the chamber, something stirs, and a faint snarl comes from the shadows.</i><br><br>
				  There is a <strong>young black dragon</strong> here. It has an AC of 4, a movement rate of 9&quot; (or 12&quot; flying), and 4 hit dice. Its breath weapon is a 3&quot;&#215;1&quot; spurt of acid which does damage equal to the dragon’s current hit points or half this number with a successful saving throw versus breath weapons. The breath weapon can be used only thrice per day. The dragon is itself immune to acid.<br><br>
				  There is also a large treasure chest at the back of the room containing 3-12 of treasure type A1.</p>
				<h1>Wrapping Up</h1>
				  <p><i>With a lot of courage and a bit of luck, the adventurers hopefully survived their encounter with the kobolds and their “pet,” returning to the town as triumphant heroes! Tamily feels truly relieved to learn that the threat is gone, especially after learning just how dangerous it was. She generously triples the reward and gives each hero 300 gold pieces.</i><br>
				  Over the coming weeks, news of the heroes’ exploits travel all across town, and soon they receive opportunities for more adventuring work. Such adventures are up to you, the referee, to determine.<br><br>
