                <div class="section-i-contents">
                  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                  <p>Delving Deeper is a gateway to realms where magic works and <a href="#dragons">dragons</a> are real, where <a href="#elves_1">elves</a> and <a href="#dwarfs_1">dwarfs</a> fight alongside <a href="#men">men</a> against <a href="#goblins">goblins</a> and <a href="#giants">giants</a>, and where a strong sword arm can carry the day in battle. All that is needed to play is some basic stationery, a few friends, and a vivid imagination.</p>
                  <p>One player will referee the fantasy <a href="#creating-a-world">world</a> while the others assume the role of adventurers and explore it. As heroes and wizards they will face its challenges, defeating <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> and winning fabulous <a href="#treasures">treasures</a> as they rise to fame or, if they are careless, vanish into obscurity.</p>
                  <h3 id="about-these-rules">About These Rules</h3>
                  <p>Players should begin with <a href="#section-i-heroes-and-magic">Section I</a> which details characters that can be played, <a href="#equipment">equipment</a> and <a href="#hirelings">hirelings</a> that can be had, and <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> that are available to magic-using sorts. Players need read no further.</p>
                  <p>Aspiring referees are advised to continue immediately on to <a href="#section-ii-delving-and-exploration">Section II</a> wherein are guidelines for constructing a <a href="#creating-a-world">campaign world</a> and filling it with <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeons</a>, <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a>, and <a href="#treasures">treasures</a>, and advice on conducting adventures around these. Finally, <a href="#section-iii-monsters-and-treasures">Section III</a> is intended as a reference for referees; it contains all manner of <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a>&#8212;from <a href="#androids">androids</a> to <a href="#zombies">zombies</a>&#8212;and <a href="#treasures">treasures</a> including magical <a href="#staves-and-wands">wands</a>, weapons, and a plethora of other items.</p>
                  <h3 id="common-terms">Common Terms</h3>
                  <p>Delving Deeper is a role-playing game in which the players control player characters (PCs) and the referee controls non-player characters (NPCs) including <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a>. All these have a number of <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a> (HD) which are six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> thrown to see how many <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> (hp) can be sustained before being slain. <a href="#melee">Armor class</a> (AC) is a measure of protection against physical attack, while <a href="#saving-throws">saving throws</a> are made to avert fates such as <a href="#poison_1">poisoning</a>, being turned to stone, or being vaporized by <a href="#dragon-breath-weapon">dragon&#8217;s breath</a>. Player characters accumulate <a href="#experience-points">experience points</a> (XP) in order to advance to each successive level of <a href="#explanation-of-abilities">ability</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="distances-ranges-and-movement-rates" class="common-term">
                    Distances, <br>
                    Ranges, and <br>
                    Movement Rates
                  </h5>
                  <p>Distances, Ranges, and Movement Rates are given as inches. An inch represents a real <a href="#encounter-distance_3">distance</a> according to the <a href="#scale">scale</a> of play. At the <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a> <a href="#scale">scale</a> 1&quot; represents 10 feet. At the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a> <a href="#scale">scale</a> 1&quot; represents 10 yards. At the overland and ocean exploration <a href="#scale">scale</a> 1&quot; of <a href="#time-and-movement_2">movement</a> represents 1 mile per day.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="dungeon-level" class="common-term">Dungeon Level</h5>
                  <p>Dungeon Level pertains to depth underground. The 1st <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level is the shallowest, the 2nd <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level is the next deeper level, and so on. Deeper <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> levels are more dangerous and more rewarding than shallower <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> levels. Players will usually determine what <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level they wish to explore.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="experience-level" class="common-term">Experience Level</h5>
                  <p>Experience Level ranks the relative power of player characters. Players begin at the 1st (least powerful) experience level and work their way upward. While experience levels are theoretically unlimited these rules assume the majority of play will occur at the 1st through 12th experience levels.</p>
                  <h5 id="gold-pieces" class="common-term">Gold Pieces</h5>
                  <p>Gold Pieces (gp) are the basic unit of currency for which goods are traded. One gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces or 100 copper pieces. There are 20 coins of any type to one pound.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="heroic-types" class="common-term">Heroic-Types</h5>
                  <p>Heroic-Types include all <a href="#man-types">man-types</a> of heroic stature and all <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> that represent a heroic threat. Collectively these are all creatures with 3 or more <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a> but fewer than 7 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="man-types" class="common-term">Man-Types</h5>
                  <p>Man-Types are all <a href="#men">men</a> and other creatures of same basic proportions including <a href="#androids">androids</a>, <a href="#cavemen">cavemen</a>, <a href="#dwarfs_1">dwarfs</a>, <a href="#elves_1">elves</a>, <a href="#gnolls">gnolls</a>, <a href="#gnomes">gnomes</a>, <a href="#goblins">goblins</a>, <a href="#halflings_1">halflings</a>, <a href="#hobgoblins">hobgoblins</a>, <a href="#kobolds">kobolds</a>, <a href="#lizardmen">lizardmen</a>, <a href="#mermen">mermen</a>, <a href="#nixies">nixies</a>, <a href="#orcs">orcs</a>, and <a href="#pixies">pixies</a>. The majority of <a href="#men">man</a>-types are also <a href="#normal-types">normal-types</a> but exceptional individuals can be <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a>- or <a href="#superheroic-types">superheroic-types</a> instead.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="monsters" class="common-term">Monsters</h5>
                  <p>Monsters are all creatures controlled by the referee. These include <a href="#dragons">dragons</a>, <a href="#orcs">orcs</a>, <a href="#vampires">vampires</a>, and other genuine horrors of the <a href="#underworld-exploration">underworld</a> as well as the townsfolk, <a href="#hirelings">hirelings</a>, and even non-player heroes of the game <a href="#creating-a-world">world</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="a-morale-check" class="common-term">Morale Check</h5>
                  <p>A Morale Check is a throw of two six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> used by the referee to determine the behavior of <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> (including <a href="#man-types">man-types</a>) in potentially life-threatening circumstances, particularly in <a href="#combat">combat</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="normal-missiles" class="common-term">Normal-Missiles</h5>
                  <p>Normal-Missiles are all non-magical projectiles including <a href="#spears">spears</a>, stones, <a href="#arrows-and-bolts">arrows</a>, and <a href="#arrows-and-bolts">bolts</a> loosed by <a href="#normal-types">normal</a> <a href="#man-types">man-types</a>. An otherwise normal missile loosed by a <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a>/<a href="#superheroic-types">superheroic-type</a> is considered <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="normal-types" class="common-term">Normal-Types</h5>
                  <p>Normal-Types include all <a href="#man-types">man-types</a> of less than <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a> status and all other creatures of similar stature. Collectively these are all creatures with fewer than 3 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="normal-weapons" class="common-term">Normal-Weapons</h5>
                  <p>Normal-Weapons are all non-magical arms including swords, <a href="#spears">spears</a>, <a href="#axes">axes</a>, and <a href="#flails-and-maces">maces</a> wielded by <a href="#normal-types">normal</a> <a href="#man-types">man-types</a>. An otherwise normal weapon wielded by a <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a>/<a href="#superheroic-types">superheroic-type</a> is considered <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="a-reaction-check" class="common-term">Reaction Check</h5>
                  <p>A Reaction Check is a throw of two six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> used by the referee to determine how <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> (including <a href="#man-types">man-types</a>) will <a href="#monster-reaction">react</a> to the players, particularly upon their first meeting and in negotiations.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="a-saving-throw" class="common-term">Saving Throw</h5>
                  <p>A Saving Throw is a throw of a single twenty-sided die used by the player to avert a potentially life-threatening calamity such as being <a href="#poison_1">poisoned</a>, turned to stone, or vaporized by a <a href="#dragons">dragon&#8217;s</a> <a href="#breath-weapon">breath weapon</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="superheroic-types" class="common-term">Superheroic-Types</h5>
                  <p>Superheroic-Types include all <a href="#man-types">man-types</a> of superheroic stature and all <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> that represent a superheroic threat. Collectively these are all creatures with 7 or more <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="a-survival-check" class="common-term">Survival Check</h5>
                  <p>A Survival Check is a throw of a hundred-sided die used by the player or referee to determine whether a character or <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> will survive being raised from the dead, <a href="#baleful-polymorph">polymorphed</a> into another shape, or restored to flesh after being turned to stone.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="turns" class="common-term">Turns</h5>
                  <p>Turns are any period during which a player chooses an action for his character. At the <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> and <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a> <a href="#scale">scales</a> a turn represents one minute. At the <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> exploration <a href="#scale">scale</a> a turn represents ten minutes. At the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> exploration <a href="#scale">scale</a> a turn represents one day.</p>
            
            
                  <h3 id="players-supplies">Player&#8217;s Supplies</h3>
                  <p>The supplies essential for play are detailed below, followed by optional extras which a player may desire. The essentials are all readily available and inexpensive (or free); even polyhedral <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> are easily obtained at hobby stores and online.</p>
                  <p><strong>The Essentials:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Delving Deeper (you have it!),</li>
                    <li><a href="#the-dice_1">Dice</a> (three six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> and one twenty-sided die per player),</li>
                    <li>Stationery (pencil, eraser, paper, and notebook),</li>
                    <li>A vivid imagination!</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Optional Extras:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A Delving Deeper player character record sheet,</li>
                    <li>Graph paper for mapping <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeons</a>,</li>
                    <li>Hexagonal paper for mapping <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> regions,</li>
                    <li>Additional <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> (any number of six-sided and twenty-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> with the latter optionally marked 0-9 twice),</li>
                    <li>Miniatures to represent the player character and his entourage,</li>
                    <li>An enterprising plan...</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h4 id="the-dice">The Dice</h4>
                  <p>Delving Deeper players require six- and twenty-sided dice. A few will do but play will be quicker with half a dozen (or more) of each. For a genuine retro feel twenty-sided dice can be marked 0-9 twice, with 0 representing ten and one of the two 0-9 series being identified as adding ten.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="preparation-for-play">Preparation for Play</h3>
                  <p>A player should initially learn something about the <a href="#creating-a-world">campaign world</a> from the referee. This information may be sketchy or generous depending on how prepared the referee is and how many players have come before. In either case it is the player&#8217;s role to insert his new character into the fantasy <a href="#creating-a-world">world</a> and augment it with his presence. Whether he comes to riches or ruin, each character should be noted!</p>
                  <p>Before choosing a character the player should familiarize himself with the options presented herein. He may desire to play a certain type of character from the outset but should be equally prepared to go with whatever the <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> may bring.</p>
                  <p>If the <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> occasionally seem unkind the player is reminded that great enjoyment can arise from unconventional characters and from dramatic demises. Such will be the fate of many adventurers.</p>
                  <p>The player should be ready to participate in the game, tackling the challenges presented with creativity and imagination&#8212;this is the greater part of the game. Above all the player must be prepared to accept the rulings of the referee and to enjoy whatever game circumstances may arise.</p>
                  <p>The adventure begins... Now!</p>
                  
                  
                  <h2 id="player-characters">Player Characters</h2>
                  <p>Having learned something about the <a href="#creating-a-world">campaign world</a> from the referee, the player&#8217;s first order of business is to construct a fantasy persona called a character. The player will thereafter control this character&#8217;s actions in the game.</p>
                  <h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
                  <p>Each character must choose a side in the eternal struggle. He is either of law or of chaos or is otherwise neutral.</p>
                  <p>Law is civility and order and upholds the greater good. Chaos is anarchy and brutality and undermines the greater good. Neutrality is neither for law nor chaos but for the individual and for those with no stake in the grander contest.</p>
                  <h3 id="determination-of-abilities">Determination of Abilities</h3>
                  <p>Characters are ranked in six <a href="#explanation-of-abilities">abilities</a>: <a href="#strength">strength</a>, <a href="#intelligence">intelligence</a>, <a href="#wisdom">wisdom</a>, <a href="#dexterity">dexterity</a>, <a href="#constitution">constitution</a>, and <a href="#charisma">charisma</a>. Each is determined, in order, by the referee with a throw of three six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> producing scores between 3 and 18. The player should record these figures on a character sheet or note paper before selecting his <a href="#classes">class</a>.</p>
                  <h3 id="prime-requisite-abilities">Prime Requisite Abilities</h3>
                  <p>One of the six <a href="#explanation-of-abilities">abilities</a> is considered to be the prime requisite for each <a href="#classes">class</a> of character. <a href="#the-fighting-man">Fighting-men</a> should be strong, <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-users</a> should be intelligent, and <a href="#the-cleric">clerics</a> should be wise.</p>
                  <p>A character will acquire a greater or lesser number of <a href="#experience-points">experience points</a> from his adventures according to his prime requisite <a href="#explanation-of-abilities">ability</a> score.</p>
                  
                  <div id="table1_1"></div>
                  
                  <p>While a high score may predispose a player toward a particular <a href="#classes">class</a> and a low score may dissuade him, <a href="#explanation-of-abilities">ability</a> scores do not preclude the selection of any <a href="#classes">class</a>. Nor do they determine a character&#8217;s success (player strategy being paramount in that).</p>
                  <p>Suppose, for example, an intending player was given these <a href="#explanation-of-abilities">ability</a> scores:</p>
                  <div id="table1_x"></div>
                  <p>With a <a href="#wisdom">wisdom</a> score of 6 this character would advance slowly as a <a href="#the-cleric">cleric</a>. His keen <a href="#intelligence">intelligence</a> means he could do well as a <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a>; however, because of a preconceived inclination toward <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a>, the player elects the role of a <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-man</a>. His <a href="#strength">strength</a> of 11 is perfectly respectable and his <a href="#constitution">constitution</a> of 12 indicates good fitness. A <a href="#dexterity">dexterity</a> score of 10 is neither quick nor slow, but his ordinary <a href="#charisma">charisma</a> score means this player should not depend overly on the <a href="#retainer-loyalty">loyalty</a> of his followers.</p>
                  <h3 id="explanation-of-abilities">Explanation of Abilities</h3>
                  <p>Following is an explanation of each of the six abilities.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="strength">Strength</h5>
                  <p>is raw physical power. It is useful for forcing <a href="#doors">doors</a>, lifting gates, and carrying heavy <a href="#equipment">equipment</a> including <a href="#treasures">treasure</a>! Strength is the <a href="#prime-requisite-abilities">prime requisite</a> for <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a>.</p>
                  <div id="table1_2"></div>
                  
                  <h5 id="movement-rates">Movement Rates</h5>
                  <p>allowed by load are for <a href="#men">man</a>-sized and <a href="#men">man</a>-like types. These should be scaled appropriately for other types but any character reduced to half his <a href="#time-and-movement_2">movement</a> rate is considered to be encumbered. <a href="#time-and-movement_2">Movement</a> rates are expressed in inches which are scaled according to the environment being explored to produce the actual ground rate.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="intelligence">Intelligence</h5>
                  <p>is cunning, acumen, and book learning and one additional <a href="#many-languages">language</a> is known for every point beyond 10. Intelligence is the <a href="#prime-requisite-abilities">prime requisite</a> for <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-users</a> and is useful to the referee for determining what course of action a non-player character should take.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="many-languages">Many Languages</h5>
                  <p>are spoken throughout the game <a href="#creating-a-world">world</a> with each intelligent type having its own tongue. <a href="#man-types">Man-types</a> also share a &#8220;common tongue&#8221; which 20% of all speaking creatures will know.</p>
                  <div id="table1_3"></div>
                  <p>Additionally, there are the tongues of law, chaos, and neutrality which are known to the speaking membership of those <a href="#alignment">alignments</a>. Creatures of one <a href="#alignment">alignment</a> will recognize the other <a href="#alignment">alignment</a> tongues without comprehending them. Chaotics will attack speakers of law and vice versa.</p>
                  <p>Player characters always know at least two languages: the common tongue and an <a href="#alignment">alignment</a> tongue. Non-human player characters may know additional languages as will all characters with above average <a href="#intelligence">intelligence</a>. Additionally, there are <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> and magic items that will aid in the comprehension of unknown languages.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="wisdom">Wisdom</h5>
                  <p>is intuition, common sense, and maturity. Each 2 points of wisdom beyond 10 will add 1 point to the character&#8217;s <a href="#prime-requisite-abilities">prime requisite</a> for the purpose of calculating <a href="#experience-points">experience points</a> earned. Wisdom is the <a href="#prime-requisite-abilities">prime requisite</a> for <a href="#the-cleric">clerics</a> and functions as does <a href="#intelligence">intelligence</a> in determining what course of action a non-player character should take.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="dexterity">Dexterity</h5>
                  <p>is reaction speed, coordination, and agility. It is useful for accurate shooting and for quick reflexes when <a href="#initiative">initiative</a> is in question. Dexterity is the <a href="#prime-requisite-abilities">prime requisite</a> for <a href="#the-thief-optional-class">thieves</a> (if these are used).</p>
                  <div id="table1_4"></div>
                  
                  <h5 id="constitution">Constitution</h5>
                  <p>is vim, fitness, and toughness. It determines what <a href="#damage">damage</a> can be endured and whether or not a character can withstand being raised from the dead, <a href="#baleful-polymorph">polymorphed</a>, or petrified.</p>
                  <div id="table1_5"></div>
                  
                  <h5 id="shock-survival">Shock Survival</h5>
                  <p>is the probability that a character will survive the greatest physical ordeals. This check is required to be raised from the dead (any failed attempt indicates that no subsequent attempt can ever succeed), to survive returning to flesh after being turned to stone, and to survive transformation into another shape by the <a href="#baleful-polymorph">baleful polymorph</a> spell.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="charisma">Charisma</h5>
                  <p>is comeliness, personal charm, and social influence. It is useful in determining <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">reactions</a>, in negotiations, and for attracting <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> into service. It determines the number of <a href="#retainers">retainers</a> a character can have and the <a href="#retainer-loyalty">loyalty</a> of any <a href="#hirelings">hirelings</a>.</p>
                  <div id="table1_6"></div>
                  
                  
                  <h3 id="classes">Classes</h3>
                  <p>Having been given <a href="#explanation-of-abilities">ability</a> scores the player must select a class. Characters begin at the 1st level in the chosen class and thereafter advance to successive experience levels by returning to a safe haven after accumulating the necessary number of <a href="#experience-points">experience points</a>.</p>
                  <h5 id="the-numbers-of-hit-dice">The numbers of hit dice</h5>
                  <p>given on the following charts are always six-sided and are thrown to determine the number of hit points of <a href="#damage">damage</a> that can be sustained before death. Hit <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> are thrown and summed with any additions being added to the total.</p>
                  <p>The figures given for each <a href="#saving-throws">saving throw</a> category are those required on a twenty-sided die to avert various calamities.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="experience-points">Experience Points</h5>
                  <p>(XP) are earned primarily by recovering (not merely finding) <a href="#treasures">treasure</a>. 1 XP is awarded per gold piece worth of <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> recovered though the division of any such riches, and hence any XP, is entirely up to the players.</p>
                  <p>Experience points are also earned by defeating <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a>. 100 XP are awarded for each <a href="#hit-dice">hit die</a> of each enemy defeated. The referee may increase the base award for especially dangerous enemies including those with <a href="#poison">poisonous</a>, paralyzing, or multiple attacks.</p>
                  <p>Experience awards for defeating <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> are scaled according to the ratio of the <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level to the character level so that higher level players are encouraged to seek appropriate challenges. If a party of 1st level characters were to defeat a dozen 1 HD <a href="#orcs">orcs</a> on the 1st <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level they would be awarded 1,200 XP between them. If a party of 6th level characters defeated the same <a href="#orcs">orcs</a> they would earn one-sixth as many XP because they are 6th level characters exploring the 1st <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level.</p>
                  <p>Note that no character can advance more than a single experience level in a single adventure. He will always fall at least 1 XP short of gaining a second experience level with any excess XP discarded.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h3 id="the-cleric">The Cleric</h3>
                  <p>Clerics must choose law or chaos; they cannot remain neutral in the eternal struggle. Either type must remain steadfast in this choice or be stripped of his status.</p>
                  <p>Clerics of the lawful sort are virtuous knights and templars whose purpose is to vanquish evil. Their conviction in the righteousness of this mission enables them to <a href="#turning-the-undead">turn the undead</a> and to invoke miracles. In performing their duty clerics are allowed <a href="#armor-and-shields">shields</a> and any <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a> but the use of edged or piercing weapons is forbidden.</p>
                  <div id="table1_8"></div>
                  <p>A cleric begins play with a <a href="#spell-books">spell book</a> containing the 1st level <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> and can thereafter <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">cast</a> a number of <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> each day appropriate for his experience level. So long as he adheres to his faith a cleric will gain access to <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> of successive spell levels as he advances in experience, and can devise <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> of his own besides.</p>
                  <div id="table1_7"></div>
                  <p>When a cleric achieves 9th level he can establish a <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> and the religious fervor of the workforce will reduce any construction costs by half. Once established, a <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> will attract a body of 50-300 fanatically loyal <a href="#men-dervishes">dervishes</a> who will serve without payment (the referee will determine the exact composition of this force). If the surrounding countryside is kept clear of <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> this holding will attract faithful settlers each of whom can pay 2 gp in tithes and taxes per month.</p>
                  <h4 id="turning-the-undead">Turning the Undead</h4>
                  <p>Mindless undead need never check <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> and cannot be <a href="#attacking-to-subdue">subdued</a> but all the undead are subject to being turned away&#8212;or even destroyed
                    utterly&#8212;by a faithful cleric who forcefully presents a Cross. Turning the undead is accomplished by throwing two six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> and comparing the result to the following table.</p>
                  <div id="table1_9"></div>
                  <p>Should a cleric fail to turn an undead <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> he cannot attempt to turn that <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> again until sunrise.</p>
                  <h4 id="the-anti-cleric">The Anti-Cleric</h4>
                  <p>Clerics of the chaotic sort are called anti-clerics. They are intended as villains and their purpose is to vanquish good. They cannot <a href="#turning-the-undead">turn the undead</a> but have a selection of reversed clerical <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> which they can employ with impunity. Otherwise, they function as do <a href="#the-cleric">clerics</a> except that an anti-cleric <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> will attract <a href="#men-zealots">zealots</a> rather than <a href="#men-dervishes">dervishes</a>.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h3 id="the-fighting-man">The Fighting-man</h3>
                  <p>Fighting-men are soldiers, champions, and other warriors who engage in toe-to-toe and <a href="#missile-fire">missile</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a>. Of all the <a href="#classes">classes</a> they are the most formidable in attack and can withstand the most <a href="#damage">damage</a>. A fighting-man has the use of any <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a> or <a href="#armor-and-shields">shield</a> and all weaponry, including <a href="#missile-fire">missiles</a> and <a href="#spears">spears</a>. Moreover, <a href="#magic-swords">magic swords</a> and the majority of other enchanted weapons are usable exclusively by them.</p>
                  <div id="table1_10"></div>
                  <p>In <a href="#melee_2">melee</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a> versus <a href="#normal-types">normal-types</a> a fighting-man throws one attack roll as a 1st level fighting-man for each of his own <a href="#hit-dice">hit die</a>. Starting at 4th level he adds +1 to <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> checks of any troops he leads in <a href="#combat">combat</a>, and he will not be targeted by <a href="#normal-types">normal-types</a> while there are <a href="#normal-types">normal</a> targets available.</p>
                  <p>At 8th level and above a fighting-man is aware of invisible opponents within 3&quot; and <a href="#normal-types">normal-types</a> require a positive <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> check to stand their ground if he charges them. He is unable to <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">cast</a> <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a>, however, and has a limited selection of other magical items.</p>
                  <p>When a fighting-man achieves 9th level he can establish a <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> and declare himself its Lord. If the surrounding countryside is kept clear of <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> this holding will attract settlers each of whom can pay 1 gp in taxes per month.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h3 id="the-magic-user">The Magic-User</h3>
                  <p>Magic-users are potentially the most powerful <a href="#classes">class</a> but they are also the most vulnerable; they can wear no <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a> and can use only <a href="#daggers">daggers</a> and <a href="#staves-and-wands">staves</a> as weapons. A magic-user can, however, <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">cast</a> magic <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a>. He begins play with a <a href="#spell-books">spell book</a> containing the 1st level <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> and can <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">cast</a> a number of <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> from memory each day appropriate for his experience level. He gains access to <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> of successive spell levels as he advances in experience, and can devise his own <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> besides.</p>
                  <p>A magic-user has use of the greatest selection of enchanted items. All save for arms (other than <a href="#daggers">daggers</a> and <a href="#staves-and-wands">staves</a>), <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a>, and a handful of clerical items are at his disposal. Should these prove insufficient a magic-user of at least 9th level can <a href="#enchanting-magic-items">enchant</a> items of his own. The cost and time required to <a href="#enchanting-magic-items">enchant</a> an item will be commensurate with its value.</p>
                  <div id="table1_11"></div>
                  <div id="table1_12"></div>
                  
                  
                  <h5 id="halflings">Halflings</h5>
                  <p>can be <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a> but are limited to 4th level. They are deadly accurate with hurled <a href="#missile-fire">missiles</a> adjusting attack rolls by +3, and will identify noises when <a href="#listening">listening</a> at <a href="#doors">doors</a> with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die. They are nearly invisible when they blend into the background and can <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a> almost silently. Despite their diminutive stature halflings are surprisingly resilient and make all <a href="#saving-throws">saving throws</a> at four levels higher than their actual level.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h5 id="dwarfs">Dwarfs</h5>
                  <p>dwell underground and see equally well by day or by night. They are limited to 6th level as <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a> but make all <a href="#saving-throws">saving throws</a> at four levels above their actual level and are the only characters able to employ the +3 <a href="#war-hammers">war hammer</a> to its full potential. They are adept at evading large, clumsy enemies and suffer only half <a href="#damage">damage</a> from foes such as <a href="#ogres">ogres</a> and <a href="#giants">giants</a>.</p>
                  <p>Dwarfs are expert miners and are able to note any new constructions, <a href="#shifting-walls">shifting walls</a>, slopes, falling slabs, false floors and the like in <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> stonework. They will identify noises when <a href="#listening">listening</a> at <a href="#doors">doors</a> with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die.</p>
                  <p>Dwarfs are able to speak the <a href="#many-languages">languages</a> of <a href="#gnomes">gnomes</a>, <a href="#goblins">goblins</a>, and <a href="#kobolds">kobolds</a> in addition to their own <a href="#many-languages">language</a>, their <a href="#alignment">alignment</a> tongue, and the common tongue.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h5 id="elves">Elves</h5>
                  <p>begin as either <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a> or <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-users</a> but can <a href="#changing-class">change class</a> between adventures as often as desired. An elf becomes dual-classed when he changes <a href="#classes">class</a> for the first time and may thereafter use both the weaponry of a <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-man</a> and the <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> of a <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> simultaneously.</p>
                  <p>The dual-classed character must maintain separate <a href="#experience-points">experience point</a> totals for each of his <a href="#classes">classes</a>, with all earned experience going toward his currently active <a href="#classes">class</a>. He uses the more favorable game statistics of both <a href="#classes">classes</a> during play but cannot act as a <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> while wearing non-magical <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a>.</p>
                  <p>Elves deal +1 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit point</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> when employing magic weapons and can <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a> and fire a <a href="#bows">bow</a> without penalty when on foot. They are nearly invisible in their gray-green cloaks and can <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a> almost silently. When actively <a href="#searching">searching</a> they will locate <a href="#secret-doors">secret doors</a> with a throw of 3-6 on a six-sided die. When merely passing by they will do so with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die. They will identify noises when <a href="#listening">listening</a> at <a href="#doors">doors</a> with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die and are immune to the paralyzing touch of <a href="#ghouls">ghouls</a> and <a href="#thulls">thulls</a>. They are, however, limited to 4th level as <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a> and to 8th level as <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-users</a>.</p>
                  <p>Elves are able to speak the <a href="#many-languages">languages</a> of <a href="#gnolls">gnolls</a>, <a href="#hobgoblins">hobgoblins</a>, and <a href="#orcs">orcs</a> as well as their own <a href="#many-languages">language</a>, their <a href="#alignment">alignment</a> tongue, and the common tongue.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h3 id="the-thief-optional-class">The Thief (Optional Class)</h3>
                  <p>Thieves are sneaks, trouble-shooters, and infiltrators who operate by cunning and subtlety. <a href="#men">Men</a>, <a href="#elves_1">elves</a>, <a href="#dwarfs_1">dwarfs</a>, and <a href="#halflings_1">halflings</a> can advance without limitation but because thieves are necessarily underhanded they cannot be aligned with law. <a href="#dexterity">Dexterity</a> is their <a href="#prime-requisite-abilities">prime requisite</a>.</p>
                  <p>Although able to employ <a href="#daggers">daggers</a>, slings, and <a href="#short-swords">short swords</a> thieves lack the resilience of proper <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a> and can wear leather <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a> only. Furthermore, a thief is best suited to striking from behind with <a href="#surprise">surprise</a>. In these circumstances a +4 adjustment is applied to the attack roll and a successful attack will cause two <a href="#damage">damage</a> <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> at levels 1-4, four <a href="#damage">damage</a> <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> at levels 5-10, and six <a href="#damage">damage</a> <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> at levels 11-12.</p>
                  <p>This aside, a thief is especially skilled in many subterfuges including:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Opening locks and foiling of magical closures,</li>
                    <li>Disarming small trapped devices such as spring-loaded <a href="#poison_1">poisoned</a> needles,</li>
                    <li>Climbing almost sheer surfaces up or down at half normal <a href="#movement-rates_1">movement rate</a>,</li>
                    <li>Identifying noises behind closed <a href="#doors">doors</a>,</li>
                    <li>Stealing or concealing items by sleight-of-hand,</li>
                    <li>Moving stealthily to pass or <a href="#surprise">surprise</a> enemies,</li>
                    <li>Hiding in nothing more than shadows,</li>
                    <li>Finding hidden or <a href="#secret-doors">secret doors</a> and passages.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>A thief accomplishes all these with a throw of 3-6 on a six-sided die. Should he fail to disarm a <a href="#tricks-and-traps">trap</a> it will instead be sprung with all the usual consequences.</p>

                  <p>At 3rd level and above a thief is equally able to discern the meaning of any non-magical cipher, message, map, or other written instruction. At 9th level and above this ability extends to <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">casting</a> <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> from <a href="#spellbooks-and-scrolls">scrolls</a>.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h3 id="changing-class">Changing Class</h3>
                  <p>Even if the referee allows <a href="#classes">class</a> changes no character can ever change <a href="#classes">class</a> during an adventure, nor can a <a href="#the-cleric">cleric</a> ever change to a <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> or vice versa. Human characters require a minimum score of 16 in the <a href="#prime-requisite-abilities">prime requisite</a> of the <a href="#classes">class</a> they intend to change to. Non-human characters have no such requirement.</p>
                  <p>A character becomes dual-classed when he changes <a href="#classes">class</a> for the first time and thereafter enjoys the benefits of both <a href="#classes">classes</a> simultaneously. A dual-classed <a href="#the-cleric">cleric</a> is always restricted in his choice of weaponry and a dual-classed <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> (other than an <a href="#elves_1">elf</a>, who may act as a <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> while wearing magical <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a>) must always go unarmored. A dual-classed <a href="#the-thief-optional-class">thief</a> (if these are used) is always restricted to leather <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a>.</p>
                  <p>The player of a dual-classed character must maintain separate <a href="#experience-points">experience point</a> totals for each of his <a href="#classes">classes</a>. Experience is only ever earned toward one <a href="#classes">class</a> at a time, as elected by the player at the beginning of each adventure. A dual-classed character may change <a href="#classes">class</a> (for the purpose of allocating <a href="#experience-points">experience points</a>) at any time, subject to the aforementioned restrictions. The more favorable game statistics of his <a href="#classes">classes</a> are used during play.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h3 id="other-classes">Other Classes</h3>
                  <p>The <a href="#classes">classes</a> herein will provide many challenges for beginners and experts alike but are by no means exhaustive. There is no reason why a player could not play a noble <a href="#centaurs">centaur</a>, a
                    cunning <a href="#lizardmen">lizardman</a>, or any other type of character should the referee permit it. Whatever these other <a href="#classes">classes</a> may be, the referee should ensure that they start out relatively weak
                    and have scope to advance in power as do the other <a href="#classes">classes</a>.</p>
                  <h3 id="beyond-level-12">Beyond Level 12</h3>
                  <p>There is no reason a human character cannot rise beyond 12th level. If higher level play is desired from the outset players should consider the limitations of non-human characters carefully before selecting them. When players progress beyond 12th level the referee can extrapolate spell <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">casting</a> progressions from the existing charts and may wish to introduce higher level <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> and <a href="#explanation-of-abilities">abilities</a> for each <a href="#classes">class</a>.</p>
                  <p>If higher level play is not desired characters can be retired after 12th level, becoming political figures in the <a href="#the-campaign">campaign</a> under the referee&#8217;s stewardship. The player is then free to create a new character to play.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>
                  <p>Each player begins with 30-180 gold pieces to furnish his character with equipment appropriate to his profession and possible adventures.</p>
                  <p>Note that 20 coins of any type weigh one pound.</p>
                  <div id="table1_14"></div>
                  <div id="table1_15"></div>
                  <p>The referee can extrapolate prices for other items from those given.</p>

                  <div id="table1_17"></div>
                  <p>Rations will feed one person for one week. Iron rations are preserved and will <a href="#keep">keep</a> even in poor environs (including <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeons</a>) where standard rations would spoil.</p>

                  <h3 id="hirelings">Hirelings</h3>
                  <p>Characters will likely require the services of hired help. Hirelings of various sorts can be found in towns, cities, and possibly in villages. Hirelings are ordinary <a href="#men">men</a> including guides, messengers, porters, and torch bearers who will perform mundane duties for <a href="#cost-of-upkeep">upkeep</a> plus a fee of 2 gp per month or 2 sp per day. With enough gold there is no limit to how many hirelings a character can employ.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="mercenaries">Mercenaries</h3>
                  <p>While ordinary <a href="#hirelings">hirelings</a> can be had for <a href="#cost-of-upkeep">upkeep</a> plus 2 gp per month <a href="#men-mercenaries">mercenaries</a> are another matter. These are neutrally aligned soldiers whose monthly fee is commensurate with their function and <a href="#equipment">equipment</a>.</p>
                  <div id="table1_19"></div>
                  <p>Monthly fees are in addition to the cost of <a href="#cost-of-upkeep">upkeep</a>.</p>
                  <p>Footmen are equipped with leather <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a> and <a href="#armor-and-shields">shield</a> and armored footmen with mail <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a> and <a href="#armor-and-shields">shield</a>. <a href="#missile-fire">Missile</a> <a href="#men">men</a> have leather <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a> only. Horsemen always have mounts in addition.</p>
                  <p><a href="#elves_1">Elf</a> and <a href="#dwarfs_1">dwarf</a> mercenaries are uncommon and <a href="#orcs">orcs</a> are employable by chaotics only; otherwise, these can be hired at towns or <a href="#strongholds">strongholds</a>, or wherever else they are encamped. With enough gold there is no limit to the number of mercenaries a character can employ.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="retainers">Retainers</h3>
                  <p>More unusual help including <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> and player types can also be sought. These are called retainers and the number allowed at any one time is limited by a character&#8217;s
                    <a href="#charisma">charisma</a> score.</p>
                  <p>A character can seek retainers during his adventures or advertise his need by posting notices, hiring heralds, frequenting taverns, or sending emissaries to foreign lands where likely candidates are known to dwell. The cost and effectiveness of these endeavors is left to the referee&#8217;s discretion.</p>
                  <p>If a prospective retainer is located the character can make an offer of employment. Only the lowest level player types will be seeking employment and these will not be tempted for any offer worth less than 100 gp. <a href="#dwarfs_1">Dwarfs</a> desire especially gold, <a href="#elves_1">elves</a> and <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-users</a> desire <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> and magic items,
                    <a href="#the-cleric">clerics</a> desire crusades and places to worship, and so on.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="enlisting-monsters">Enlisting Monsters</h3>
                  <p>Characters can enlist <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> of the same <a href="#alignment">alignment</a> by regular negotiation. Others (including higher level player types) can be pressed into service by coercion with a charm spell or by physical <a href="#attacking-to-subdue">subdual</a> in <a href="#combat">combat</a>.</p>
                  <p>Magic <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> notwithstanding, some incentive must be offered to entice a <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> into service. The character should decide what he believes would be useful or valuable to the <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> and make his offer (merely sparing its life is insufficient). The <a href="#monsters_2">monster&#8217;s</a> <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">reaction</a> will be determined by the referee and adjusted according to the offer and the character&#8217;s <a href="#charisma">charisma</a>. A character can attempt a richer offer only if the <a href="#monsters_2">monster&#8217;s</a> <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">reaction</a> is &#8220;uncertain&#8221;.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="retainer-loyalty">Retainer Loyalty</h4>
                  <p>When a <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> or non-player character enters into a player character&#8217;s service the referee will secretly determine his loyalty, which may subsequently be adjusted for excellent or poor treatment. Additional pay, gifts of arms, <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a>, or magic items, and the rising fame (or infamy) of an employer can increase loyalty. Unjust treatment, poor prospects, or unfit conditions can decrease loyalty.</p>
                  <p>So long as a <a href="#retainers">retainer</a> is treated reasonably, receives the agreed payment, and is not exposed to unnecessary danger his loyalty will not be tested. In extreme circumstances, however, the referee will use <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">reaction</a> checks or <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> checks to determine how a <a href="#retainers">retainer</a> will behave.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="reaction-and-morale-checks">Reaction and Morale Checks</h3>
                  <p>When required, reaction and morale checks are made by the referee with a throw of two six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> and are adjusted for <a href="#retainer-loyalty">loyalty</a>. A high result indicates a positive reaction or good morale and a low result indicates a negative reaction or poor morale.</p>
                  <p>Retainers will obey orders to the best of their ability so long as their morale holds. A poor morale check can result in refusal to perform; exactly how this plays out is left to the referee&#8217;s discretion. It could result in dissension, refusal to undertake a task or join <a href="#combat">combat</a>, withdrawal from <a href="#combat">combat</a>, desertion, surrender to the enemy, complete rout, and so on.</p>
                  <p>Excepting unintelligent <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> (who never check morale) most enemies are also subject to failures of morale.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="relatives">Relatives</h3>
                  <p>Player characters possess arms, <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a>, and <a href="#equipment">equipment</a> from the outset and&#8212;if they are fortunate&#8212;can accumulate considerable wealth during their adventures. Thus a character is permitted to name an heir to his estate should he meet an untimely end. If he should mysteriously vanish &#8220;death&#8221; can be declared after 30 days of unexplained absence.</p>
                  <p>Once death has been established all worldly possessions are passed to the designated heir, if there is one, or else to the realm if there is not. Should there be an heir he takes possession of all properties, goods, and valuables that belonged to the departed less a 10% inheritance tax which is payable to the realm. The realm may also enforce payment of a bond to any <a href="#hirelings">hirelings</a> and <a href="#retainers">retainers</a>, guaranteeing the return of their possessions and any accrued pay to their families.</p>
                  <p>Should the character unexpectedly return to reclaim his estate the inheritance tax will be payable again. The referee will adjudicate the <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">reaction</a> of the disinherited heir who might intrigue to retain control of the estate. In any case, his <a href="#retainer-loyalty">loyalty</a> will suffer a 0 to &#8722;5 adjustment (one six-sided die &#8722;1) if he is kept on as part of the character&#8217;s household or retinue.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="cost-of-upkeep">Cost of Upkeep</h3>
                  <p>While dwelling in a village, town, or city a character must pay upkeep for himself and his entourage. At its simplest the cost of upkeep for middling quarters and fare is 1 gp per month per 100 <a href="#experience-points">experience points</a> the character has.</p>
                  <p>A character who desires fine cuisine and luxurious accommodation must consent to pay higher costs, varying with extravagance. Alternatively, the referee may require players to itemize individual expenses.</p>
                  <p>The cost of upkeep is payable only so long as the character maintains urban living arrangements. Living off the land incurs no costs and thus payments cease when the character journeys to a <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> area. When he builds a <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> of his own he may collect taxes from its inhabitants to help cover his costs.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h2 id="magic">Magic</h2>
                  <p>A <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> or <a href="#the-cleric">cleric</a> can memorize a number of <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> each day according to his experience level. He must be fresh and rested and have access to the appropriate <a href="#spell-books">spell books</a> to memorize any spell therein. Bereft of his <a href="#spell-books">spell books</a> he cannot memorize any <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a>!</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="spell-casting-from-memory">Spell Casting from Memory</h3>
                  <p>A memorized spell can be cast at any time but once it has been cast it is erased from memory. Once erased a spell cannot be cast again until it is memorized the following day. Notwithstanding this limitation, nothing prevents a <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> or <a href="#the-cleric">cleric</a> from memorizing the same spell several times.</p>
                  <p>In order to invoke a spell the caster must be free to concentrate, <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a> his arms and hands, speak aloud, and see the target. To do so during <a href="#combat">combat</a> the player must declare his <a href="#intent">intent</a> at the beginning of the <a href="#turns">turn</a>. Casting a spell requires the full <a href="#turns">turn</a> so no other action may be attempted. Furthermore, if the caster is struck by any <a href="#missile-fire">missile</a>, blow, or spell before his own invocation is completed it will be foiled and erased from memory without being triggered. The referee will adjudicate whether other interruptions are sufficient to foil a spell.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="spell-casting-from-scrolls">Spell Casting from Scrolls</h3>
                  <p>A <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> or <a href="#the-cleric">cleric</a> can <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">cast</a> a spell of any spell level directly from a <a href="#spellbooks-and-scrolls">scroll</a>. Unless the <a href="#spellbooks-and-scrolls">scroll</a> was penned by his own hand a <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> must employ a <a href="#read-magic">read magic</a> spell before he can read a <a href="#spell-scrolls">spell scroll</a>. Thereafter, either <a href="#classes">class</a> can read a <a href="#spell-scrolls">spell scroll</a> without memorizing the spell in advance. <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">Casting</a> a spell from a <a href="#spellbooks-and-scrolls">scroll</a> invokes the magic at the minimum caster level necessary to memorize the spell and simultaneously erases the spell from the <a href="#spellbooks-and-scrolls">scroll</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="reversible-spells">Reversible Spells</h3>
                  <p>If a <a href="#the-cleric">cleric</a> spell is noted as reversible, only a chaotic <a href="#the-anti-cleric">anti-cleric</a> can use the reverse form and only a lawful <a href="#the-cleric">cleric</a> can use the proper form. If a <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> spell is noted as reversible, the reverse form is a separate spell which can be memorized, <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">cast</a>, and written to a <a href="#spellbooks-and-scrolls">scroll</a> exactly as per any other spell.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="spell-books">Spell Books</h3>
                  <p>Magic-users and <a href="#the-cleric">clerics</a> begin play with a book of 1st level <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> but must find, buy, or <a href="#researching-new-spells">research</a> higher level spell books thereafter.</p>
                  <p>Adventuring is a dangerous business so a spell caster may wish to construct a duplicate spell book to carry without risk to his primary resource. Should a spell book be <a href="#becoming-lost">lost</a>, damaged, or destroyed in any event it can be replaced at a cost. A book of 1st level <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> costs 2,000 gp, a book of 2nd level <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> costs 4,000 gp, a book of 3rd level <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> costs 8,000 gp, and so on.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="creating-spell-scrolls">Creating Spell Scrolls</h3>
                  <p>Magic-users and <a href="#the-cleric">clerics</a> can copy <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> which they can memorize onto <a href="#spellbooks-and-scrolls">scrolls</a>. It takes one week to create any <a href="#spell-scrolls">spell scroll</a> and costs 100 gp per spell level. Thus, a 4th level <a href="#spell-scrolls">spell scroll</a> takes one week to construct at a cost of 400 gp. A <a href="#spell-scrolls">spell scroll</a> can be invoked only once and is at risk of being ruined by rain, fire, and other <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> hazards.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="researching-new-spells">Researching New Spells</h3>
                  <p>Clerics and <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-users</a> can research new <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> for their repertoires. The spell level of a new spell cannot exceed that which the researcher is able to memorize. Otherwise, the player can contrive whatever spell he desires, remembering that the referee will determine what is allowable and the spell level of the new magic.</p>
                  <p>Success is a matter of time and investment. One week and 2,000 gp are required for a 1st level spell. Costs double and time is extended by one week at each successively higher spell level. Thus, a 2nd level spell requires two weeks and 4,000 gp, a 3rd level spell requires three weeks and 8,000 gp, a 4th level spell requires four weeks and 16,000 gp and so on.</p>

                  <h2 id="preparation-for-the-campaign">Preparation for the Campaign</h2>
                  <p>The referee should be comfortable with these rules and the mechanics of play, but even then a new <a href="#the-campaign">campaign</a> requires some preparation before play can start. The referee begins by envisaging a fantasy <a href="#creating-a-world">world</a> in which his new <a href="#the-campaign">campaign</a> will take place. He need not etch out the entire history of the <a href="#creating-a-world">world</a> immediately; the merest hint of what the <a href="#creating-a-world">world</a> might promise is sufficient at this early stage. Next, he requires the outline of a continent or similar region for the players to explore. Finally, he requires a detailed map of a town or village and the countryside in which play will begin.</p>
                  <p>The referee should familiarize himself with the geography, water sources, and <a href="#settlements-and-strongholds_1">settlements</a> (human and otherwise) near to the start of play, noting any particular detail of each. Using broad strokes rather than exacting detail will save time and allow room for the players to influence the <a href="#creating-a-world">world</a>, encouraging a dynamic <a href="#the-campaign">campaign</a> that feels &#8220;alive&#8221;.</p>
                  <p>After establishing the <a href="#creating-a-world">campaign world</a> the referee should map several <a href="#underworld-exploration">underworld</a> <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeons</a> and stock these with <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a>, <a href="#treasures">treasures</a>, and magical items. Once these <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeons</a> are created the referee should mark them on his map somewhere in the vicinity of the start of play. The <a href="#the-campaign">campaign</a> is then ready and the players can begin exploring the fantasy milieu in which they find themselves.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="the-referees-supplies">The Referee&#8217;s Supplies</h3>
                  <p>In addition to those supplies recommended for players the referee should furnish himself with the following:</p>
                  <p id="the-essentials"><strong>The Essentials:</strong></p>

                  </ul>
                  
                  <h2 id="creating-a-world">Creating a World</h2>
                  <p>The referee begins by creating a map of the world on a sheet of hex paper. This map need not be extensive as exploration of the unknown is a desired element of the <a href="#the-campaign">campaign</a>. It must, however, remain unknown to the players.</p>
                  <p>Each hex should be 6 miles wide on this map such that an unencumbered <a href="#men">man</a> afoot can cover two hexes per day of good hiking and an encumbered <a href="#men">man</a> can cover one hex per day.</p>
                  <p>The referee should note at least one civilized <a href="#settlements-and-strongholds_1">settlement</a> (the village, town, or <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> where play will begin) near the center of his map. He should then add any immediately surrounding features including other villages, nearby towns, a <a href="#keep">keep</a>, a ruin, caves, a forest, a swamp, and so on. The referee should name each feature and decide whether it is abandoned or inhabited, and (if so) by whom? Denizens might be ordinary lawful folk, <a href="#elves_1">elves</a>, <a href="#men-bandits">bandits</a>, a knight and his entourage, <a href="#orcs">orcs</a>,
                    <a href="#trolls">trolls</a>, an evil high priest, and so on. Thus the game world begins to take shape.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="the-start-of-play">The Start of Play</h3>
                  <p>Play should commence in a (relatively) safe haven such as a town, village, or <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a>. Towns are busy regional centers, home to 1,000-6,000 folk from all walks of life including many itinerants. Villages are quiet, agrarian communities of 100-400 farming folk. <a href="#strongholds">Strongholds</a> are occupied by bodies of 30-180 soldiery along with a prominent leader and his supporting entourage. Wherever they begin, players should be able to acquire their starting goods and <a href="#legend-and-rumors">rumors</a> of possible adventures.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="legend-and-rumors">Legend and Rumors</h4>
                  <p>The players might already know some of the <a href="#the-campaign">campaign&#8217;s</a> cultural folklore. Other tales and local legends can be devised by the referee and learned by the players as required.</p>
                  <p>The arrival or formation of a company of armed adventurers will not go unnoticed and, unless the players take pains to conceal their purpose, rumors will quickly spread. The players may, of course, desire to advertise their presence in order to gain employment.</p>
                  <p>Obtaining news and rumors is thereafter a matter of visiting local inns and common rooms where a liberal round of drinks worth 10-60 gp will usually get tongues wagging, or where an earnest barkeep might be willing to help for 1-6 gp. Misinformation may be learned at the referee&#8217;s discretion.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="angry-villagers">Angry Villagers</h4>
                  <p>In time the players might become fearless heroes (or feared anti-heroes). This does not imply that exploitation of the common folk will be without consequence. Unhappy commoners will first seek the protection of the church and their local lords. Failing that they will seek out a hero to fight their cause or, ultimately, rise up as an angry lynch mob to run despots and villains out of town.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="hireling-and-retainer-loyalty">Hireling and Retainer Loyalty</h4>
                  <p>Whenever <a href="#hirelings">hirelings</a> or <a href="#retainers">retainers</a> are taken on the referee should secretly determine their <a href="#retainer-loyalty">loyalty</a> score. A <a href="#hirelings">hireling</a> or <a href="#retainers">retainer&#8217;s</a> <a href="#retainer-loyalty">loyalty</a> score is determined with a throw of three six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a>, then adjusted according to an initial <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">reaction</a> check (&#8722;2 to +2), the character&#8217;s <a href="#retainer-loyalty">loyalty</a> adjustment due to <a href="#charisma">charisma</a> (&#8722;2 to +4), and whether or not the <a href="#hirelings">hireling</a> or <a href="#retainers">retainer</a> is a disinherited <a href="#relatives">relative</a> (0 to &#8722;5). The result is noted by the referee, to be referred to whenever subsequent <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">reaction</a> or <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> checks are required.</p>
                  <div id="table2_1"></div>
                  
                  <h3 id="the-dice_1">The Dice</h3>
                  <p>Delving Deeper referees require polyhedral dice of the four-, six-, eight-, ten-, twelve-, and twenty-sided sorts and are assumed to possess these.</p>
                  <p>Wherever number ranges appear in the text the referee should throw the appropriate number of dice to produce a result within the specified range. For example, a range of 1-6 is generated by throwing a six-sided die, a range of 2-7 is generated by throwing a six-sided die and adding 1 to the result, a range of 2-10 is generated by throwing a six- and a four-sided die and summing the results, and so on.</p>
                  <p>Common number ranges are given in the table below&#8212;the referee can extrapolate other ranges from these examples. A ten-sided die should ideally be a twenty-sided polyhedron marked 0-9 twice, but alternatively can be a ten-sided polyhedron marked 0-9 once (although these are not a platonic solid).</p>
                  <p>A range of 1-100 can be generated with a throw of two ten-sided dice. The result of the first die is multiplied by ten before the pair is summed. Thus, a throw of 4 and 2 makes 42, a throw of 6 and 0 makes 60, and a throw of 0 and 6 makes 06. A double zero makes 100.</p>

                  <h2 id="creating-a-dungeon">Creating a Dungeon</h2>
                  <p>Before the players can explore the labyrinthine <a href="#underworld-exploration">underworld</a> the referee must map at least one such <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> on a sheet of graph paper. A <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> should have many levels and sub-levels that are interconnected by stairs, trapdoors, chutes, slanting passages, and so on. The referee is advised to begin by drawing a cross section of the entire structure in order to understand the means of egress between the various levels.</p>
                  <p>It is desirable that there be several <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> entrances, that there be a number routes between the various levels, and that richer areas be harder to find. Deeper <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> levels will be more rewarding but also more dangerous, so players should (usually) be allowed to navigate to the desired <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level when such routes are known.</p>
                  <p>A <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> need not be mapped completely&#8212;it may well be vast or even limitless. It should, however, extend as far as the players are likely to explore in their initial delve. Thus, the referee is advised to plan much of the first level and some parts of the second and third levels. Each square of a <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level plan should represent 10ft in the <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> and, like the <a href="#the-campaign">campaign</a> map, <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> maps must remain unknown to the players.</p>
                  <p>Having drawn a cross section and begun mapping of the first few levels, the referee should give the <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> a name and note at least one entrance to the first <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level on his <a href="#the-campaign">campaign</a> map.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="populating-a-dungeon">Populating a Dungeon</h3>
                  <p>With a dungeon level planned, or substantially so, the referee must distribute <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a>, <a href="#tricks-and-traps">traps</a>, and <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> throughout the maze. The principal
                    <a href="#treasures">treasures</a> should be placed thoughtfully, then random determination used to fill the balance of the level.</p>
                  <p>The referee should throw two six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> for each unpopulated dungeon location and consult the table of random dungeon locations.</p>

                  <p>Empty rooms occur frequently and will usually be welcomed even if they are foreboding or completely nondescript. These might be used by the players to <a href="#resting">rest</a> or regroup, lay ambushes, establish a defensible position, or whatever else the referee allows.</p>
                  <h4 id="monsters_1">Monsters</h4>
                  <p>Where Monsters are indicated the referee should consult the random monster tables for the appropriate <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level. Note that monsters are not all &#8220;meant&#8221; to be beatable. Some will be deadly foes and players should learn to flee from these.</p>

                  <p>will compel a victim to perform some <a href="#quest">quest</a>, deed, or undesirable action. Possibilities include abandoning all carried <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> in a nearby vault, submitting oneself to an evil high priest, converting a dozen people to the chaotic <a href="#alignment">alignment</a>, or slaying the <a href="#dragons">dragon</a> on the next <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="illusions">Illusions</h5>
                  <p>can be of anything at all including glamorous <a href="#treasures">treasure</a>, impassible obstacles, irresistible feasts, distraught prisoners, luxurious appointments over squalor, or solid footing over openings. The purpose of these is to deter or delay progress, draw the unwary into a <a href="#tricks-and-traps">trap</a>, conceal some route or object, or to raise an alarm if meddled with.</p>

                  <h5 id="pits">Pits</h5>
                  <p>are typically 10-40ft deep and either open or covered by trapdoor lids. When passed over a trapdoor will open if the referee throws a 5-6 on a six-sided die and some will automatically snap shut. A pit could be empty or contain a <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a>. Hitting the bottom will cause 1-6 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> per 10ft fallen and any <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> present will automatically have the advantage of <a href="#surprise">surprise</a> in the following <a href="#turns">turn</a>. Deep pits could be filled with water causing armored characters to <a href="#drowning">drown</a>. Shallow pits could contain <a href="#spears">spears</a> or jagged rocks pointing upward that will cause an additional 2-12 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> should anyone <a href="#falling">fall</a> upon them. <a href="#spears">Spears</a> present may or may not be <a href="#poison_1">poisoned</a>.</p>

                  <p>might be moved by player action or by automation, intermittently revealing (or concealing) stairs, passages, or secret vaults or simply preventing the players from returning the way they came. Fresh <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> sections can be revealed and tried sections hidden. Whole sections can <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a> in a clockwork labyrinth.</p>

                  <p>can seal the players in by closing portals or by barring exits with heavy weights. Some will then fill with water, <a href="#green-slime">green slime</a>, or <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a>. Others will carry the players to a lower <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level with no possible recourse&#8212;or seem to while in fact only turning on the same level.</p>

                  <h5 id="teleportation">Teleportation</h5>
                  <p>will instantly send an individual or a group elsewhere upon touching a gem, skull, or mirror, or upon passing through a portal. Possible destinations include an identical room with nothing to indicate that teleportation has occurred, a <a href="#dragons">dragon&#8217;s</a> lair, a safe haven, another <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level, a location thousands of miles away, or even another planet or alternate dimension.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="trick-doors">Trick Doors</h5>
                  <p>are of many kinds including <a href="#secret-doors">secret doors</a>, false <a href="#doors">doors</a> or portals that lead only to dead ends, <a href="#doors">doors</a> that will open only when a password is spoken or a riddle is solved, <a href="#doors">doors</a> that can be opened from one side but not the other, portals that can only be found intermittently, or <a href="#doors">doors</a> whose destination changes each time they are used.

                  <p>are of various designs including stairs not deep enough to change level, stairs whose destination changes each time they are used, stairs that collapse into a steeply inclined slide which is a one-way route to a <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> lair or deeper <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level, stairs that can only be found intermittently, and so on.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="treasure-guarded-by-monsters">Treasure Guarded by Monsters</h4>
                  <p><a href="#monsters_2">Monsters</a> guarding <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> are determined with the random monster tables. If the resulting <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> has a <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> type and appropriate numbers can be accommodated then the location can be a lair. Otherwise it is not a lair and the <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> includes 400-2,400 sp per <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level, 50% chance of 200-1,200 gp per <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level, 5% chance per <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level of 1-6 gems + 1 gem per <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level, 5% chance per <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level of 1-6 pieces of jewelry, and 5% chance per two <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> levels of one item from the Magic Items table.</p>
                  <p>Where non-player characters are indicated, these are bands of 1-6 player-types of randomly determined <a href="#classes">class</a>; <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a>, <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-users</a>, or <a href="#the-cleric">clerics</a> (with <a href="#the-thief-optional-class">thieves</a> optionally appearing). Each non-player character has 1-3 experience levels plus as many experience levels as the <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level they are encountered on. The whole group will be accompanied by 2-12 <a href="#mercenaries">mercenaries</a> as well as 1-6 pages, acolytes, or apprentices with up to half as many experience levels as their least experienced superior.</p>
                  <p>Fighting-men have a 10% chance per experience level of possessing a <a href="#magic-swords">magic sword</a> and are half as likely to possess a magic <a href="#armor-and-shields">shield</a> or magic <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a>. <a href="#the-cleric">Clerics</a> are 2% likely per experience level to possess a magic <a href="#flails-and-maces">mace</a>, <a href="#flails-and-maces">flail</a>, hammer, or <a href="#staves-and-wands">staff</a> and are 5% likely to possess a magic <a href="#armor-and-shields">shield</a> or magic <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a>. <a href="#the-magic-user">Magic-users</a> are 5% likely per experience level to possess a magic <a href="#staves-and-wands">wand</a> and are equally likely to possess a magic <a href="#rings">ring</a> or a <a href="#miscellaneous-magic-items">miscellaneous magic item</a>. In all cases, check separately for each item.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="treasure-guarded-by-traps">Treasure Guarded by Traps</h4>
                  <p>Traps are frequently set to guard <a href="#treasures">treasures</a>. Where this is indicated the <a href="#tricks-and-traps">trap</a> can be designed thoughtfully to fit the environs or determined with the <a href="#tricks-and-traps">tricks</a> and <a href="#tricks-and-traps">traps</a> table (substituting a deadly <a href="#tricks-and-traps">trap</a> for any <a href="#sloping-passages">sloping passage</a> or <a href="#oblique-construction">oblique construction</a>). The <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> is as described above.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="unguarded-treasure">Unguarded Treasure</h4>
                  <p>Unguarded <a href="#treasures">treasures</a> are as above and should be hidden behind <a href="#secret-doors">secret doors</a>, under trapdoors or floors, up chimneys, made to look plain or invisible by <a href="#illusions">illusions</a>, or locked in safes or strong boxes. In short, the players should face some challenge to gain them.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id="underworld-exploration">Underworld Exploration</h2>
                  <p>The referee is advised to <a href="#keep">keep</a> careful track of time and resources as the players explore the underworld. Exploration is conducted in <a href="#turns">turns</a> of 10 minute duration with 1&quot; representing 10ft. Thus a <a href="#movement-rates_1">movement rate</a> of 12&quot; is reckoned to be 120ft underground with two such <a href="#time-and-movement_2">moves</a> allowed per <a href="#turns">turn</a> of cautious progress; <a href="#listening">listening</a> for noises, watching for ambush, making a map, and so on. If all caution is abandoned (during <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">flight or pursuit</a>, for example) <a href="#time-and-movement_2">movement</a> is quadrupled but mapping becomes impossible.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="searching">Searching</h5>
                  <p>for <a href="#tricks-and-traps">traps</a>, <a href="#treasures">treasure</a>, or <a href="#secret-doors">secret doors</a> should take a full <a href="#turns">turn</a>. The referee must adjudicate how long other activities will take including hiding, use of divinations, and circumventing <a href="#tricks-and-traps">traps</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="light_2">Light</h5>
                  <p>is essential underground. Torches, lanterns, and magic <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> can be used to illuminate the way though the former might be extinguished by sudden gusts of <a href="#strong-winds">wind</a>. Torches and lanterns will light a 30ft radius and burn for 6 and 24 <a href="#turns">turns</a>, respectively. <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">Dungeon</a> denizens are assumed to see well in the dark, however, and carrying light will ruin any possibility of surprising them, except by coming through a <a href="#doors">door</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="listening">Listening</h5>
                  <p>A <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> should be troubled by distant creaks, echoes, and moans, and any player may wish to listen for these, or at a <a href="#doors">door</a> before trying it, as a precautionary measure. In such cases the referee should throw a six-sided die for the player with a result of 6 (or a result of 5-6 for <a href="#dwarfs_1">dwarfs</a>, <a href="#elves_1">elves</a>, and <a href="#halflings_1">halflings</a>) indicating that the character identifies any audible sound. Bickering <a href="#orcs">orcs</a> will be rackety, for example, while the undead will be absolutely silent.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="doors">Doors</h5>
                  <p>in the <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> are typically stuck and must be forced by <a href="#strength">strength</a>. <a href="#men">Men</a>, <a href="#dwarfs_1">dwarfs</a>, and <a href="#elves_1">elves</a> can defeat these with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die, while <a href="#halflings_1">halflings</a> and other weaklings would usually require a throw of 6. Bursting through a door in this manner might <a href="#surprise">surprise</a> whomever is on the other side, but any failed attempt will automatically ruin this opportunity and might also attract <a href="#wandering-monsters">wandering monsters</a> to the noise. Two characters can simultaneously apply their <a href="#strength">strength</a> to a single door, but they will be unable to <a href="#monster-reaction">react</a> to whatever is lurking on the other side as they burst through.</p>
                  <p>Dungeon denizens have the knack of opening each <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> door and can pass through easily unless a door has been held shut by the characters. Despite the difficulty in opening them, doors will automatically close. Even if a door is wedged open by the characters it will later be found to have been closed if the referee throws a 5-6 on a six-sided die.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="secret-doors">Secret doors</h5>
                  <p>and passages will be discovered by any player actively <a href="#searching">searching</a> if the referee throws a 5-6 (or 3-6 for <a href="#elves_1">elves</a> and also <a href="#the-thief-optional-class">thieves</a> if these are used) on a six-sided die. Locating a secret <a href="#doors">door</a> will reveal the mechanism for opening it, but not activate it. The secret <a href="#doors">door</a> must be intentionally opened by the character.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="rest">Rest</h5>
                  <p>One <a href="#turns">turn</a> of <a href="#resting">rest</a> is required after a <a href="#combat">combat</a> or any hour of exploration and two <a href="#turns">turns</a> of <a href="#resting">rest</a> are required after <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">flight or pursuit</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="traps">Traps</h5>
                  <p>are sprung if the referee throws a 5-6 on a six-sided die as a character passes over or nearby. Many of these are deadly. <a href="#tricks-and-traps">Traps</a> can be located before they are sprung, however, in much the same manner as can <a href="#secret-doors">secret doors</a>. A <a href="#tricks-and-traps">trap</a> can usually be circumvented or avoided once it has been found.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="underworld-encounters">Underworld Encounters</h3>
                  <p>Each <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level can contain thoughtfully prepared <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounters</a> as well as <a href="#wandering-monsters">wandering monsters</a>. The former are <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> lairs, hideouts, treasuries, meeting places, and so on devised during <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> design. The referee should also check for <a href="#wandering-monsters">wandering monsters</a> at the end of each <a href="#turns">turn</a> of exploration. This is done by throwing a six-sided die with a 6 indicating the appearance of <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a>.</p>
                  <p>The kind of <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> should be determined randomly. This is accomplished by dicing for the <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> table to use and then dicing on that table to determine which kind of <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> appears.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="wandering-monsters">Wandering Monsters</h4>
                  <p>The number of wandering <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> appearing should be as per the &#8220;No. Encountered&#8221; for their type. Having determined their numbers the referee should then throw to determine whether there is a lair of such <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> nearby. If so, then any member of the wandering group slain or captured is deducted from those found later in the lair.</p>
                  <p>More fearsome <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> will often be fewer in number, but even the lowliest sorts can be deadly in their multitudes. The referee can exercise his discretion if an undesired <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> is indicated, remembering that deeper <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> levels are intended to be more dangerous than shallower <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> levels.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="surprise">Surprise</h4>
                  <p>When <a href="#wandering-monsters">wandering monsters</a> occur the referee should first determine whether either party is surprised. <a href="#surprise">Surprise</a> is possible only when either or both parties are unaware of the other. <a href="#light_2">Light</a>, noise, <a href="#listening">listening</a> at or forcing <a href="#doors">doors</a>, and various divinations can negate the possibility of <a href="#surprise">surprise</a>; otherwise, either party will <a href="#surprise">surprise</a> the other with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die. <a href="#the-thief-optional-class">Thieves</a> (if these are used) instead <a href="#surprise">surprise</a> with a throw of 3-6.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="encounter-distance">Encounter Distance</h4>
                  <p>If either party is surprised the <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> will begin at 10-60ft distance and the surprised party will be unable to respond for one <a href="#turns">turn</a>; otherwise, the <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> will begin at 20-120ft distance. <a href="#melee_2">Melee</a> range is 1&quot; (10ft in the <a href="#underworld-exploration">underworld</a>).</p>

                  <p>With or without <a href="#surprise">surprise</a> the direction and manner of a <a href="#monsters_2">monster&#8217;s</a> approach should be adjudicated by the referee in accordance with its type, the surroundings, and the disposition of the players. Unintelligent <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> will simply attack, while those with any cunning will judge the situation accordingly. Chaotics are predisposed to attack lawfuls, and vice versa, and <a href="#normal-types">normal</a> <a href="#man-types">man-types</a> will only attack 4th (or higher) level <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a> if there are no other targets.</p>
                  <p>The referee can otherwise determine <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> behavior according to the following table, adjusting any result for bribes offered, perceived threats, differences of race or <a href="#alignment">alignment</a>, and so on.</p>
                  <div id="table2_7"></div>
                  
                  <h4 id="avoiding-monsters">Avoiding Monsters</h4>
                  <p>The players have the option to flee unchallenged whenever <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> are surprised or are more than 3&quot; (30ft in the <a href="#underworld-exploration">underworld</a>) distant. <a href="#monsters_2">Monsters</a> will <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursue</a> unless they are surprised or have a proper motivation not to.</p>
                  <p>Flight and <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursuit</a> <a href="#speed">speed</a> is four times normal pace with no mapping possible. The gap will open or close according to the <a href="#movement-rates_1">movement rates</a> of the two parties, and <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursuit</a> will continue for so long as the pursuers do not fall more than a full <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a> behind (more than 90ft behind for pursuers with a <a href="#movement-rates_1">movement rate</a> of 9&quot;). The players may wish to discard <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> or <a href="#equipment">equipment</a> in order to lighten their encumbrance and increase their <a href="#speed">speed</a>. Should the players turn a corner, take a stair, or pass through a <a href="#doors">door</a> the pursuers will continue only if a throw of a six-sided die is 5-6.</p>
                  <p>Discarded foodstuffs will distract unintelligent pursuers with a throw of 2-6 on a six-sided die, and animal or intelligent pursuers with a throw of 4-6 or 6, respectively. <a href="#treasures">Treasure</a> is inversely likely to distract pursuers and burning oil is also an effective deterrent.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="maintaining-freshness">Maintaining Freshness</h3>
                  <p>As the players explore a <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level its <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> stocks and <a href="#treasures">treasures</a> will begin to be diminished and so too will its mystery. While egress to the greater challenges of lower levels is desirable, the referee should never allow any <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level to become too well known.</p>
                  <p>If even a single chamber is left unguarded for any length of time there is the possibility of new denizens arriving to replace losses. These might be from adjacent areas, lower levels, or newly excavated passages. <a href="#monsters_2">Monsters</a> that previously eluded the players might fortify areas by blocking or collapsing passages, barring <a href="#doors">doors</a>, setting new <a href="#tricks-and-traps">traps</a>, and so on. Intelligent <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> might set alarms or leave warnings in case of the players&#8217; return.</p>
                  <p>The referee should not shy from extending the limits of a <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> so that fresh areas always await exploration. Should the players nonetheless become blasé, the referee can introduce wholesale change due to cave-in, subsidence, flooding, supernatural winter, reality <a href="#distortions">distortion</a>, slime plague, and so on. These are but a few of the options the referee can employ to <a href="#keep">keep</a> a <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> fresh and challenging.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
                  <p>These mechanics are intentionally abstract so that combat is fast and furious.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="scale">Scale</h5>
                  <p>For the purpose of <a href="#underworld-exploration">underworld</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a> 1&quot; represents 10ft and each <a href="#turns">turn</a> is one minute in duration. A lot can happen in one minute of <a href="#combat">combat</a> and any <a href="#turns">turn</a> can be decisive.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="surprise_1">Surprise</h5>
                  <p>allows one <a href="#turns">turn</a> of unanswered actions. If these should include attacks they will be at +2 to hit and, if struck, the target will drop anything held with a throw of 1-2 on a six-sided die.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="intent">Intent</h5>
                  <p>Each player declares his intent for the upcoming <a href="#turns">turn</a>, stating whether his character will attack, utter a spell, overturn a boiling <a href="#cauldron">cauldron</a>, or whatever.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="initiative">Initiative</h5>
                  <p>The referee resolves all actions for the <a href="#turns">turn</a> in whatever order he judges fair.</p>
                  <p>He may grant initiative to those firing <a href="#missile-fire">missiles</a> into advancing enemies, or to those with the advantage of reach (in the first <a href="#turns">turn</a>) or lighter weapons (in subsequent <a href="#turns">turns</a>), or to those fighting on battlements above. Otherwise, initiative is determined by throwing a six-sided die per group, or per combatant (adjusting for <a href="#dexterity">dexterity</a>), with the higher score gaining the first opportunity to attack that <a href="#turns">turn</a>.</p>
                  <p>Magic <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> can be <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">cast</a> successfully in the <a href="#turns">turn</a> that <a href="#melee_2">melee</a> is joined if the caster wins initiative; otherwise, the caster is interrupted and his spell is ruined before completion. While a spell caster remains engaged in <a href="#melee_2">melee</a> spell <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">casting</a> is not possible.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="melee">Melee</h3>
                  <p>Any character within 1&quot; is eligible to attack or be attacked in melee <a href="#combat">combat</a>.</p>
                  <p>Performance throughout a <a href="#turns">turn</a> of <a href="#combat">combat</a> is determined with a single attack roll&#8212;a throw of one twenty-sided die. However, against <a href="#normal-types">normal-types</a>, <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> and <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a> instead throw one attack roll for each of their own <a href="#hit-dice">hit die</a>.</p>
                  <p>When a single attack roll is used the attacker strikes according to his level (for characters) or number of <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a> (for <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a>). When multiple attack rolls are used the attacker always strikes as a 1 <a href="#hit-dice">hit die</a> <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a>, regardless of how many levels or <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a> he actually has.</p>
                  <div id="table2_8"></div>
                  <p>In either case attack rolls are adjusted for tactical factors, magic weaponry, and enchantments and the result compared to the target&#8217;s <a href="#melee">armor class</a> on the attack matrix. A total equal to or greater than the number required indicates an effective <a href="#turns">turn</a> of action (a &#8220;hit&#8221;). Anything less indicates an ineffective <a href="#turns">turn</a> of action (a &#8220;miss&#8221;).</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="space-required">Space Required</h4>
                  <p>Note that <a href="#melee_2">melee</a> requires space. The referee should allow perhaps three <a href="#men">men</a> to stand abreast in a 10ft wide passage if they carry <a href="#spears">spears</a>; swords and <a href="#axes">axes</a> would require more space. Up to six <a href="#men">men</a> can surround a single <a href="#men">man</a>-sized target (with rear attacks striking at +2 to hit), while up to eight <a href="#men">men</a> can surround a larger <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="parrying">Parrying</h4>
                  <p>A defender can forgo his attack to parry and cause an opponent to suffer a &#8722;4 attack penalty. Should his opponent miss because of this &#8722;4 penalty the defender&#8217;s weapon will be dashed from his grasp by a heavier weapon. If, on the other hand, his opponent misses regardless of this penalty the defender is allowed a counter-attack if equipped with a lighter weapon.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="damage">Damage</h4>
                  <p>If a single attack roll is used a hit will cause 1-6 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of damage and be adjusted for <a href="#strength">strength</a>, magical weaponry, and other factors. <a href="#spears">Spears</a> set to receive a charge and charging lancers will instead cause 2-12 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> damage and large <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> can cause more damage. If multiple attack rolls are used versus <a href="#normal-types">normal-types</a>, each hit causes exactly 1-6 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of damage; all other adjustments are already represented by the multiple attack rolls.</p>
                  <p>Should any character be reduced to zero (or fewer) <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a>, he is slain. Whether or not sustaining damage will otherwise affect a character is left to the referee&#8217;s discretion. Any unresolved attacks of a slain character are wasted.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="attacking-to-subdue">Attacking to Subdue</h4>
                  <p>Most intelligent <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> (including <a href="#man-types">man-types</a>) can be subdued and made to surrender if this <a href="#intent">intent</a> is announced prior to attacks being resolved. <a href="#damage">Damage</a> from subdual hits is recorded independently of <a href="#damage">damage</a> from actual hits. After any <a href="#turns">turn</a> in which <a href="#damage">damage</a> is suffered the referee must determine the sum of subdual <a href="#damage">damage</a> sustained as a percentage of actual <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a>. Confidence is then checked by throwing a hundred-sided die with any result lower than the percentage of subdual <a href="#damage">damage</a> sustained indicating the <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> is subdued.</p>
                  <p>Subdued <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> will initially obey without <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">reaction</a> checks and can be sold as slaves, pets, or curiosities or brought into service as <a href="#retainers">retainers</a> if an acceptable offer is made.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="overbearing">Overbearing</h3>
                  <p>Man-types can grapple an enemy bare-handed in order to overpower and capture him without killing him.</p>
                  <p>If the defender is armed, or is not a <a href="#man-types">man-type</a>, each attacker must make a successful attack roll before being able to contribute to the overbearing attempt. Each contributing attacker throws a six-sided die for each of his own <a href="#hit-dice">hit die</a> (although no more than six <a href="#men">men</a> can attempt to overbear a single <a href="#men">man</a> at a time).</p>
                  <p>The defender then throws one six-sided die for each of his <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a> and the totals are compared. If the attackers&#8217; total is higher the defender will be hopelessly pinned. If the scores are equal the struggle is unresolved and can continue next <a href="#turns">turn</a>. If the defender&#8217;s total is higher the attackers are thrown back 1&quot; and unable to participate in the struggle next <a href="#turns">turn</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="missile-fire">Missile Fire</h3>
                  <p>Missile fire is as <a href="#melee_2">melee</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a> except that attack rolls represent shooting at range and are adjusted for <a href="#dexterity">dexterity</a>. Short range fire (including most <a href="#missile-fire">missiles</a> shot underground) is at +2 to hit. Hand-hurled <a href="#missile-fire">missiles</a> are reckoned to always be at medium range and are thus at +1 to hit. Long range <a href="#missile-fire">missile</a> fire is usually possible only outdoors and is at normal hit probability. <a href="#bows">Bows</a> can throw two attack rolls per <a href="#turns">turn</a> if stationary. All <a href="#missile-fire">missile</a> fire on the <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a> (other than <a href="#elves_1">elves</a> firing <a href="#bows">bows</a>) is at &#8722;2 to hit. Firing from or into <a href="#melee_2">melee</a> is not normally allowed.</p>
                  <p>Fireballs, <a href="#lightning-bolt">lightning bolts</a>, and like <a href="#missile-fire">missiles</a> must occupy their full area of effect. Hurling these into confined <a href="#space-required">spaces</a> will cause them to rebound off walls to fill the necessary <a href="#space-required">space</a>, including back towards the caster.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="morale">Morale</h3>
                  <p>A <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> check can be used to determine how <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> (including <a href="#man-types">man-types</a>) will <a href="#monster-reaction">react</a> in potentially life-threatening circumstances.</p>
                  <p>The referee alone adjudicates when <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> should be checked but will normally do so whenever potentially deadly circumstances occur. Thus, <a href="#hirelings">hireling</a> or <a href="#retainers">retainer</a> <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> would be checked when a deadly <a href="#tricks-and-traps">trap</a> is sprung, when attacked by <a href="#surprise">surprise</a>, when losing a battle (at one-third losses), when a leader is slain, captured, or routed.</p>
                  <p>Particularly fearsome foes including the greater <a href="#dragons">dragons</a> and <a href="#rocs">rocs</a>, <a href="#wraiths">wraiths</a>, and 8th (or higher) level <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a> will cause <a href="#normal-types">normal-types</a> (including player characters) to check <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> merely by attacking.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="morale-checks">Morale Checks</h4>
                  <p>The players have their own <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> so their characters are not subject to <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> checks unless compelled by magic or other <a href="#heroic-types">super-normal</a> threat. It may, however, be necessary to check the <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> of <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> (including <a href="#man-types">man-types</a>) either fighting the players or serving them. Unintelligent <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> need never check <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a>.</p>
                  <p>A <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> check is made by throwing two six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> for the affected party. The total is adjusted for <a href="#retainer-loyalty">loyalty</a>, <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> type, and other circumstances as appropriate.</p>
                  <div id="table2_9"></div>
                  
                  <h4 id="adjustments-to-morale-check">Adjustments to Morale Check</h4>
                  <p>Monsters are assumed to have <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> adjustments as stated in the <a href="#explanation-of-monsters">explanation of monsters</a>; however, the referee may wish to ascribe a <a href="#retainer-loyalty">loyalty</a> score to particular individuals. This can be done in the same manner as for <a href="#hirelings">hirelings</a> or <a href="#retainers">retainers</a> serving the players (by summing three six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a>) or by edict. High or low <a href="#retainer-loyalty">loyalty</a> would adjust a <a href="#monsters_2">monster&#8217;s</a> <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> checks accordingly, overruling the generic <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> adjustments given in the <a href="#explanation-of-monsters">explanation of monsters</a>.</p>
                  <p>The referee can also adjust <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> checks for specific circumstances including:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Those fighting alongside a 4th (or higher) level <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-man</a> adjust their <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> by +1,</li>

                    <li>A <a href="#bless">bless</a> spell adjusts <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> checks of those affected by +1,</li>
                    <li><a href="#orcs">Orcs</a>, <a href="#goblins">goblins</a>, and <a href="#hobgoblins">hobgoblins</a> suffer a &#8722;1 <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> penalty in daylight,</li>

                  <p>The referee can determine <a href="#monsters_2">monsters&#8217;</a> (or <a href="#retainers">retainers&#8217;</a>) behavior for the next <a href="#turns">turn</a> by throwing a <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> check and consulting the <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> check table.</p>
                  <p>The referee should interpret the outcome by considering the capabilities and disposition of the affected party; non-combatants would not attack, troops defending a fortification would not abandon their advantage, and so on.</p>

                  <p>Lost <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> can be recovered by magical means and by ordinary <a href="#resting">rest</a>, albeit at a much slower rate.

                  <h4 id="jousting">Jousting!</h4>
                  <p>Jousts are knightly contests of <a href="#mounted-combat">mounted</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a>. A <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-man</a> must possess <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a>, <a href="#armor-and-shields">shield</a>, <a href="#magical-helms">helm</a>, mount, and at least one lance to participate.</p>
                  <p>A joust is scored as the best of three tilts in which two <a href="#mounted-combat">mounted</a> knights enter the lists and, separated by a barrier, make an unimpeded charge at one another with the objective of unhorsing the opponent. Each throws a single, simultaneous attack roll adjusted for the quality of his mount: <a href="#horses">destrier</a> +8, <a href="#horses">war horse</a> +6, riding or <a href="#horses">draft horse</a> +2. On a hit throw two six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> and consult the jousting table. For sport the lesser of the two <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> indicates <a href="#damage">damage</a> sustained; in war <a href="#damage">damage</a> is the sum of both <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a>.</p>
                  <div id="table2_10"></div>
                  <p>A glancing blow scores no points. Breaking a lance upon the opponent scores one point, or three points upon the opponent&#8217;s <a href="#magical-helms">helmet</a>. Unhorsing the opponent scores ten points. If a knight cannot continue due to injury he loses. The loser forfeits his mount or a grander wager by prior arrangement.</p>

Otherwise, <a href="#mounted-combat">mounted</a> <a href="#man-types">man-types</a> attack those on foot at +2. <a href="#mounted-combat">Mounted</a> <a href="#horses">war horses</a> and <a href="#wolves-giant">giant wolves</a> can also attack enemies on foot, having one attack roll per <a href="#turns">turn</a> even versus <a href="#normal-types">normal-types</a>.</p>

A <a href="#mounted-combat">mounted</a> <a href="#heroic-types">heroic-type</a> is subject to <a href="#missile-fire">missile</a> fire only on a six-sided die throw of 5-6; otherwise his mount is subject to that <a href="#missile-fire">missile</a> fire.</p>
                  <p>Any hit on a rider will unhorse him on a six-sided die throw of 6. He will crash to the ground and be stunned for the remainder of the <a href="#turns">turn</a> and, if he throws 1-4 on a six-sided die, for all of the following <a href="#turns">turn</a> in addition. Should a rider or his mount be slain he is likewise unhorsed.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="saving-throws">Saving Throws</h3>
                  <p>Saving throws are used when deadly threats occur. They represent one last chance to avert disaster. Players throw for their characters and the referee throws for the <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a>. If either throws equal to or greater than the indicated number in the required category the direst consequences are avoided. Anything less invites disaster.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="poison">Poison</h5>
                  <p>includes diseases and all deadly biological attacks such as <a href="#snakes-giant-and-large">snake</a> bites, <a href="#scorpions-giant">scorpion</a>, <a href="#spiders-giant-and-large">spider</a> or <a href="#wyverns">wyvern</a> stings, imbibing poisoned wine, and wounds from envenomed weapons.

                  <h5 id="wands-and-rays">Wands and Rays</h5>
                  <p>includes rays, beams, and other attacks which can be dodged or deflected including <a href="#staves-and-wands">wands</a> of paralysis and lightning. This category is also used against the <a href="#disintegrate">disintegrate</a>, finger of death, and <a href="#lightning-bolt">lightning bolt</a> <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="paralysis-and-petrification">Paralysis and Petrification</h5>
                  <p>includes gross physiological attacks such as paralysis by contact with a <a href="#a-gelatinous-cube">gelatinous cube</a> or petrification by <a href="#medusae">medusa</a>, <a href="#basilisks">basilisk</a>, <a href="#cockatrices">cockatrice</a>, or <a href="#gorgons">gorgon</a> attack.

                  <h4 id="saving-throws-for-magical-items">Saving Throws for Magical Items</h4>
                  <p>With the exception of <a href="#magical-helms">helms</a> (which can be destroyed in <a href="#combat">combat</a>), magic items are assumed to remain intact so long as the player survives. However, the referee may wish to allow items to be destroyed when the character is slain or otherwise exposed to particularly adverse circumstances. In this case the referee should make a <a href="#saving-throws">saving throw</a> for each item concerned.</p>
                  <div id="table2_11"></div>
                  <p>Arms, <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a>, <a href="#armor-and-shields">shields</a>, and <a href="#protection">rings of protection</a> add their defensive adjustment to their <a href="#saving-throws">saving throws</a>. Items that produce spell-like effects adjust their <a href="#saving-throws">saving throw</a> by +2 against similar effects. Thus, a <a href="#wand-of-fireball">wand of fireball</a> and a <a href="#flametongue">flametongue</a> sword would save at +2 versus <a href="#dragons-red">red dragon&#8217;s</a> <a href="#breath-weapon">breath weapon</a>.</p>
                  <p>The referee should be circumspect about item <a href="#saving-throws">saving throws</a>. Effects such as <a href="#neutralize-poison">poison</a>, <a href="#confusion">confusion</a>, and <a href="#feeblemind">feeblemind</a> would not affect most magic items but petrification and disintegration would.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id="wilderness-exploration">Wilderness Exploration</h2>
                  <p>The referee will already have a map of the players&#8217; starting location and the surrounding countryside. This will be critical for further exploration and for the establishment of <a href="#strongholds">strongholds</a>, trade, and alliances later in the game. Whether regions unknown to the players are drawn in advance or as they are explored is up the referee. In either case the principal features should be placed thoughtfully with the remainder being filled in by random determination.</p>
                  <div id="table2_12"></div>
                  <p>In addition to its terrain type each hexagon can possibly contain one (or more) significant features. These can be determined as opposite:</p>
                  <div id="table2_13"></div>
                  <p>Note that rivers and trails should span a number of hexagons. Except in mountains (where rivers begin), swamps (where rivers end), and open hexes (where trails end), the referee should place these features without dicing when all other adjoining hexes have been resolved without these occurring.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="time-and-movement">Time and Movement</h3>
                  <p>For the purpose of <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> exploration 1&quot; represents 1 mile and each <a href="#turns">turn</a> is a day in duration. The standard <a href="#movement-rates_1">movement rates</a> in inches are therefore the number of miles covered per day. Each hexagon is assumed to be 6 miles across, so the standard <a href="#movement-rates_1">movement rates</a> can be translated easily into a number of hexagons covered per day.</p>
                  <div id="table2_14"></div>
                  <p>Difficult terrain including woods, swamps, and desert slow ground <a href="#time-and-movement_2">movement</a> by half except along a trail. Rivers are impassable other than at <a href="#fords">fords</a> and bridges, as are mountains other than by trails that can be navigated only on foot at half rate.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="visibility">Visibility</h4>
                  <p>Visibility is generally limited to one hex (6 miles) range from a good vantage in open terrain. However, the referee may wish to allow <a href="#visibility">visibility</a> of up to three hexes (18 miles) when surveying open terrain from mountain passes, or up to 11-16 hexes (up to 100 miles) from a lofty mountain summit in clear <a href="#weather">weather</a>. Note that intervening terrain and <a href="#weather">weather</a> conditions can severely restrict <a href="#visibility">visibility</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="resting">Resting</h4>
                  <p>All travelers require a full day of <a href="#resting">rest</a> after six days on the <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a>. <a href="#dragons">Dragons</a> instead require a full week of sleep after six weeks of activity.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="weather">Weather</h3>
                  <p>Weather conditions should be determined each day in the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a>. If the previous day was hot throw one six-sided die and add 1. If it rained the previous day throw one six-sided die and add 6. Otherwise, throw two six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> to determine <a href="#weather">weather</a> conditions each day.</p>
                  <div id="table2_15"></div>
                  <p>Hot <a href="#weather">weather</a> will cause thirst, increase fatigue, and halve <a href="#movement-rates_1">movement rate</a>. Hot <a href="#weather">weather</a> will also increase the risk of fire in the dry season.</p>
                  <p>Rain of any sort will reduce <a href="#visibility">visibility</a>. Hard rain will halve <a href="#movement-rates_1">movement rate</a>, as will any rain in the wet season.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="becoming-lost">Becoming Lost</h3>
                  <p>So long as players stick to established routes they will have little difficulty navigating from one <a href="#settlements-and-strongholds_1">settlement</a> to another. However, once they strike out into the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a>, there is the possibility of becoming <a href="#becoming-lost">lost</a>. The referee should secretly throw a six-sided die for the players each day with a 1 (in open terrain), a 1-2 (in woods or mountains), or a 1-3 (in swamp or desert) indicating that the players have gotten <a href="#becoming-lost">lost</a>. If the players are <a href="#becoming-lost">lost</a> they will <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a> in an undesired direction that day without realizing it.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="strongholds">Strongholds</h3>
                  <p>Where a stronghold is indicated it is an occupied <a href="#keep">keep</a>, tower, or fastness at a strategic locale such as a bluff, crossroad, valley, bridge, or island. The principal resident of the stronghold should be determined randomly, as follows:</p>
                  <div id="table2_16"></div>
                  <p>The resident will be of 9th to 12th experience level and will be attended by an entourage as indicated above. These are as for a lair of the appropriate type or else 1-6 individuals where no lair type is given. Heroes and anti-heroes indicate bands of 3-18 <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a> of 3rd to 6th experience level (determined individually).</p>
                  <p>The resident may also have one or several lieutenants of level 5-8. A <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-man</a> is 50% likely to be attended by a <a href="#the-cleric">cleric</a> or a <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a>. A <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> is 50% likely to be attended by a <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-man</a> or 1-6 apprentices ( <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-users</a> of level 3-6). A <a href="#the-cleric">cleric</a> is 50% likely to be attended by a <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-man</a> or 1-6 assistants ( <a href="#the-cleric">clerics</a> of level 3-6). Check separately for either in all cases.</p>
                  <p>Regardless of the above a <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> is occupied by a force of 30-180 soldiers with a similar number of supporting <a href="#staves-and-wands">staff</a>. If the principal resident is chaotic these are 50% likely to be <a href="#orcs">orcs</a>; otherwise, they are <a href="#men">men</a>.</p>
                  <p>Should the characters pass near a <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a>, the resident&#8217;s scouts or <a href="#spies">spies</a> will spot them with a throw of 6 on a six-sided die at two hexes <a href="#encounter-distance_3">distance</a>, with a throw of 5-6 at one hex <a href="#encounter-distance_3">distance</a>, and with a throw of 3-6 if they pass within the same hex as the <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> itself. If they are spotted, or if they hail the <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> directly, the resident will respond to their presence.</p>
                  <p>A chaotic strongholder will always attempt to slay, capture, enslave, or deceive the players to gain whatever <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> or knowledge they might have or hold out against them if they are overly powerful.</p>
                  <p>A resident <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-man</a> will challenge the highest level <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-man</a> to a <a href="#jousting">joust</a>. Should the player <a href="#jousting">joust</a> and win he earns the right to the challenger&#8217;s hospitality for up to a full month for himself and his company&#8212;although a chaotic or neutral challenger may prove reluctant to pay!</p>
                  <p>Should the player <a href="#jousting">joust</a> and lose the challenger will demand his mount. If the players lack a <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-man</a> or decline the contest, the challenger will levy a toll of 1,000-4,000 gp for their passage.</p>
                  <p>A <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> will exact a toll of one magic item of his choice from the player characters or else 1,000-6,000 gp if they have nothing desirable. If they cannot pay the <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> may <a href="#geases">geas</a> them to collect the necessary <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> on some <a href="#quest">quest</a>. The <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> will take his pick of any <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> recovered, or perhaps all of it.</p>
                  <p>A lawful <a href="#the-cleric">cleric</a> will require a tribute for his temple amounting to one-tenth part of whatever wealth the player characters have. If they cannot pay the <a href="#the-cleric">cleric</a> may <a href="#quest">quest</a> them to perform some lawful mission&#8212;which will earn them his hospitality if completed successfully. An <a href="#the-anti-cleric">anti-cleric</a> may demand one-fourth part of whatever wealth the player characters have. If they cannot pay he might simply slay them or else <a href="#quest">quest</a> them to perform some chaotic mission&#8212;which might be their undoing.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="fords">Fords</h3>
                  <p>Rivers and waterways are generally impassable other than at fords and bridges (except with a <a href="#control-water">control water</a> spell). These will frequently be occupied and, should an <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> occur in the vicinity of a ford or bridge, the referee may assume the <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> is at that feature.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="settlements">Settlements</h3>
                  <p>Villages and towns have 100-400 and 1,000-6,000 inhabitants, respectively. Areas surrounding friendly towns are usually relatively safe. Farther from civilization roads are unkempt and there are few patrols. Folk in these parts are unfriendly, if not dangerous, and any kind of <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> might be encountered.</p>
                  <p>The referee can assume that the 3 hexes (18 mile radius) around a friendly <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> is cleared, patrolled, or otherwise relatively safe. Towns and villages control smaller areas, but all that lies beyond this immediate vicinity is known as &#8220;<a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a>&#8221;. These vast tracts are nonetheless dotted with villages and castles of unknown disposition, as well as enclaves, ruins, and other curiosities awaiting discovery.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="wilderness-encounters">Wilderness Encounters</h3>
                  <p>Wandering <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> occur in the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> as they do in the <a href="#underworld-exploration">underworld</a>. The referee should check once per day in the immediate vicinity of a friendly <a href="#settlements-and-strongholds_1">settlement</a> or <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> with a throw of 6 on a six-sided die indicating an encounter. In the
                    <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> proper he should check once per day in open terrain or desert or twice per day in woods, swamps, mountains, and riverlands. The referee should make one additional check per day if the players are <a href="#becoming-lost">lost</a> or are at a bridge or <a href="#fords">ford</a>.</p>
                  <p>When an encounter is indicated the referee can determine the type of <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> by dicing on the appropriate <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> encounter table for the terrain type.</p>

                  <p>Surprise occurs in the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> (as it does in the <a href="#underworld-exploration">underworld</a>) with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die except that animals will not be surprised from upwind. If the players are surprised they will typically find themselves encircled.</p>

                  <h4 id="encounter-distance_1">Encounter Distance</h4>
                  <p>If either party is surprised an <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> will begin at 10-60 yards distance and the surprised party will be unable to respond for one <a href="#turns">turn</a>; otherwise, an <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> will begin at 20-120 yards distance. <a href="#melee_2">Melee</a> range is 1&quot; (10 yards) in the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a>.</p>

                  <h3 id="evasion-and-pursuit">Evasion and Pursuit</h3>
                  <p>A smaller group may desire to <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">evade</a> a larger group rather than <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> them. Hostile <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> (including previously offended <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> residents) will <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursue</a> with a throw of 4-6 on a six-sided die, while non-hostiles will <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursue</a> only with a throw of 6.</p>
                  <p>The possibility of evading an <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> is determined by the <a href="#relatives">relative</a> size of the parties. If the evaders are not more than one-quarter as numerous as the pursuers they will <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">evade</a> with a throw of 3-6 on a six-sided die. If they are no more than half as numerous as the pursuers they will <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">evade</a> with a throw of 4-6; otherwise they will <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">evade</a> only with a throw of 5-6.</p>
                  <p>The odds of <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">evasion</a> are adjusted as follows:</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="surprise_3">Surprise</h4>
                  <p>If the pursuers are surprised <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">evasion</a> is 1 chance in 6 more likely. If the evaders are surprised there is no opportunity to <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">evade</a> unless low <a href="#visibility">visibility</a> or good <a href="#speed">speed</a> dicates otherwise.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="low-visibility">Low visibility</h4>
                  <p>Woods, misty swamps, night, rain, fog, or snow all increase the chance of <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">evasion</a> by 1 in 6, even if surprised.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="speed">Speed</h4>
                  <p>If either side&#8217;s <a href="#movement-rates_1">movement rate</a> is at least twice the other side&#8217;s <a href="#movement-rates_1">movement rate</a> the odds of <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">evasion</a> (or <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursuit</a>) are tipped in their favor by 1 chance in 6, even if surprised.</p>
                  <p>To resolve a <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursuit</a> scenario the evaders should throw one die. If the result is too low to <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">evade</a>, the <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursuit</a> catches up and an <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> is unavoidable; otherwise, the evaders have managed to gain ground over the <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursuit</a>.</p>
                  <p>Assuming the evaders have gained ground, the referee should determine whether or not the pursuers will continue to give chase. Unless specific circumstances dictate otherwise, the chase will continue with a throw of 4-6 on a six-sided die. If the pursuers throw high enough they gain ground and the <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursuit</a> is still on; otherwise, they have fallen too far behind and the <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursuit</a> is over.</p>
                  <p>This is repeated until either the pursuers give up or an <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> occurs.</p>
                  <p>Note that mapping is impossible during a <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursuit</a>. The referee should position the evaders somewhere within 1-6 hexes of their starting location at the conclusion of a chase.</p>
                  <p>Both parties must <a href="#resting">rest</a> for the remainder of the <a href="#turns">turn</a> (the day) after resolving a <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursuit</a>, regardless of whether it resulted in an <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> or not. At the beginning of the next <a href="#turns">turn</a> (day) the players are considered to be <a href="#becoming-lost">lost</a>. They will not know exactly where they are, only that they have endured a long <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursuit</a> and covered many leagues in a general direction.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id="seafaring-exploration">Seafaring Exploration</h2>
                  <p>As with <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> exploration, ocean regions unknown to the players can be mapped in advance or as they are explored. The principal features should be placed thoughtfully with the remainder being filled in by random determination.</p>
                  <p>The referee can use the random <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> tables to generate ocean regions for seafaring. Hexes of open terrain should be read as open ocean, woods as coast, mountains as reefs, desert as islands, and swamp as perpetually stormy ocean. Likewise, rivers should be read as strong currents, <a href="#fords">fords</a> as confluences of currents, and trails as navigable seafaring routes. The other features are as in the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> except that villages should be ignored.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="time-and-movement_1">Time and Movement</h3>
                  <p>Seafaring exploration retains the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> exploration timescale of 1 <a href="#turns">turn</a> per day.</p>
                  <div id="table2_18"></div>
                  <p>Coastal waters (up to 3 hexes from land) and navigable inland rivers retain the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> exploration <a href="#scale">scale</a> where each 1&quot; of <a href="#movement-rates_1">movement rate</a> represents 1 mile traveled per day. The open ocean, however, is so vast and generally free of obstruction that sailing rate is improved threefold such that 1&quot; of <a href="#time-and-movement_2">movement</a> represents 1 league (3 miles) traveled per day.</p>
                  <p>Exploration by sea is otherwise similar to <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> exploration excepting that players must have an ocean going <a href="#oared-vessels">vessel</a>. These are of two types: <a href="#oared-vessels">oared</a> and sailed.</p>
                  <h5 id="oared-vessels">Oared vessels</h5>
                  <p>such as galleys and longships are not restricted by <a href="#strong-winds">wind</a> direction but galleys, rafts, and boats are unable to withstand the high seas of the open ocean. These are limited to coastal waters except in calm <a href="#weather">weather</a>.</p>
                  <h5 id="sailed-vessels">Sailed vessels</h5>
                  <p>such as merchants and warships can run swiftly before the <a href="#strong-winds">wind</a>, but otherwise must progress by a series of turns and tacks at impaired <a href="#speed">speed</a>. Travel directly into the <a href="#strong-winds">wind</a> is generally impossible.</p>
                  <p>Movement rates for <a href="#oared-vessels">oared</a> ships assume a full and well trained crew. Poor or incomplete crews can achieve half the listed rate.</p>
                  <p>Movement rates for sailing ships assume running fore a fresh <a href="#strong-winds">wind</a>. All other <a href="#time-and-movement_2">movement</a> is at half rate. Note that sailing rates are faster on the open ocean due to the possibility of sailing unimpeded day and night.</p>
                  <p>One hexagon should be added when traveling with a current or subtracted when traveling against a current.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="reserves">Reserves</h4>
                  <p>With the exception of boats and rafts, all sailing ships carry reserve oars and all <a href="#oared-vessels">oared</a> ships carry reserve <a href="#sailed-vessels">sails</a> to be used if necessary. These allow <a href="#time-and-movement_2">movement</a> at half rate.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="resting_1">Resting</h4>
                  <p>All crews require a full day of <a href="#resting">rest</a> after six days at sea or immediately after weathering a <a href="#storms_1">storm</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="visibility_1">Visibility</h4>
                  <p>Distance to the horizon is determined by height above sea level. From a ship&#8217;s deck <a href="#visibility">visibility</a> is limited to one hex (6 miles). From a crow&#8217;s nest a <a href="#sailors">sailor</a> can see a ship up to two hexes (12 miles) away in clear <a href="#weather">weather</a>. However, <a href="#weather">weather</a> conditions can severely restrict <a href="#visibility">visibility</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="weather_1">Weather</h3>
                  <p>The <a href="#strong-winds">wind</a> <a href="#strength">strength</a> and direction should be determined each day at sea. Throw one six-sided die to determine which hex face the <a href="#strong-winds">wind</a> is blowing from and two six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> to determine <a href="#strong-winds">wind</a> <a href="#strength">strength</a>.</p>
                  <div id="table2_19"></div>
                  
                  <h4 id="strong-winds">Strong Winds</h4>
                  <p>Boats, rafts, and galleys will capsize in strong <a href="#strong-winds">winds</a> on the open ocean on a throw of 1-2 on a six-sided die each <a href="#turns">turn</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="storms">Storms</h4>
                  <p>Navigation is impossible in storm conditions and any <a href="#oared-vessels">vessel</a> will capsize on a throw of 1-2 on a six-sided die each <a href="#turns">turn</a>. Any <a href="#oared-vessels">vessel</a> that does not capsize is instead moved 2-7 hexes in a direction secretly determined by the referee and is immediately considered to be <a href="#becoming-lost">lost</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="becoming-lost_1">Becoming Lost</h3>
                  <p>A ship&#8217;s <a href="#a-ships-captain">captain</a> will have no difficulty navigating a known route so long as the <a href="#weather">weather</a> remains fair. However, should the <a href="#weather">weather</a> turn nasty, there is the possibility of becoming <a href="#becoming-lost">lost</a>. The referee should secretly throw a six-sided die for the players each day spent in strong <a href="#strong-winds">winds</a>&#8212;a 1-2 indicating they have gotten <a href="#becoming-lost">lost</a>. If the players are <a href="#becoming-lost">lost</a> the referee should <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a> them an unplanned <a href="#encounter-distance_3">distance</a>/direction on his map that <a href="#turns">turn</a> without alerting them.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="settlements-and-strongholds">Settlements and Strongholds</h3>
                  <p>Settlements and <a href="#strongholds">strongholds</a> occur at sea as they do in the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a>. These can be wholly or partially submerged, built upon floating pontoons, clinging to rocky prominences, or whatever else the referee desires. Whether these are friendly or unfriendly can be determined with a <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">reaction</a> check.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="encounters-at-sea">Encounters at Sea</h3>
                  <p>Wandering <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> occur at sea much as they do in the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a>. The referee need not check for <a href="#wandering-monsters">wandering monsters</a> while the players are within 3 hexes (18 miles) of a friendly port, but once out to sea proper he should check once each day on the open ocean or twice each day along a coast or waterway. An additional check should be made each day if the players are <a href="#becoming-lost">lost</a>. A throw of 6 on a six-sided die indicates an <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> will occur.</p>
                  <p>When an <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> is indicated, determine the type of <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> by dicing on the appropriate <a href="#seafaring-exploration">seafaring</a> <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> table. If the players are traveling along a coast or inland waterway an <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> is equally likely to occur ashore as at sea. In this case, use the appropriate <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> table.</p>
                  <div id="table2_20"></div>
                  
                  <h4 id="surprise_4">Surprise</h4>
                  <p>Surprise occurs at sea (as it does in the <a href="#underworld-exploration">underworld</a>) with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die. If the players are surprised the enemy ships or <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> will come at them from upwind, emerge suddenly out of fog banks or rain squalls, appear from behind rolling waves, or surface unexpectedly from underwater.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="encounter-distance_2">Encounter Distance</h4>
                  <p>If either party is surprised an <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> will begin at 10-60 yards distance and the surprised party will be unable to respond for one <a href="#turns">turn</a>; otherwise, an <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> will begin at 40-240 yards distance. <a href="#melee_2">Melee</a> range is 1&quot; (10 yards as in the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a>). Shipboard artillery range is typically 300 yards.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="monster-reaction_1">Monster Reaction</h4>
                  <p>Monster <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">reaction</a> to the players at sea is as per the <a href="#underworld-exploration">underworld</a>.</p>
                  <h3 id="evasion-and-pursuit_1">Evasion and Pursuit</h3>
                  <p>Evasion and <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursuit</a> at sea is as per the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> with the following additional considerations:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Low <a href="#visibility">visibility</a> occurs in <a href="#storms_1">storms</a>, rain, fog, and at night,</li>
                    <li>Evaders who are able to submerge will automatically escape pursuers without this ability unless they are surprised.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h3 id="seafaring-combat">Seafaring Combat</h3>
                  <p>Vessels can engage in ship-to-ship (or ship-to-<a href="#sea-monsters">sea monster</a>) <a href="#combat">combat</a>. Ships are treated much as <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a>&#8212;having hull <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> instead of <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a>, and hull points instead of <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a>.</p>
                  <div id="table2_21"></div>
                  <p>When ship-to-ship (or ship-to-<a href="#sea-monsters">sea monster</a>) <a href="#combat">combat</a> occurs the referee should use the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a> <a href="#scale">scale</a> (1&quot; to 10 yards and one minute <a href="#turns">turns</a>) to resolve maneuvering and <a href="#missile-fire">missile</a> fire as the combatants approach one another.</p>
                  <p>Wind direction, tactical positions, and <a href="#oared-vessels">vessel</a> facings can be marked on a <a href="#scale">scale</a> map if desired or simply noted as closing <a href="#encounter-distance_3">distances</a>. <a href="#oared-vessels">Oared</a> ships can produce a burst of <a href="#speed">speed</a> during <a href="#combat">combat</a>, adding 6&quot; to <a href="#movement-rates_1">movement rate</a> for up to three <a href="#turns">turns</a> after which the crew is exhausted.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="missile-fire_1">Missile Fire</h4>
                  <p>Ship-board artillery may be fired every other <a href="#turns">turn</a> while <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> and <a href="#missile-fire">missiles</a> may be loosed each <a href="#turns">turn</a>. <a href="#normal-missiles">Normal missiles</a> are ineffective against ship hulls but are allowed their maximum outdoor range, giving due consideration to <a href="#weather">weather</a> conditions and ocean swell.</p>
                  <p>Small galleys are assumed to carry a single artillery battery on the fore deck. Large galleys carry two batteries (one fore and one aft), and warships carry four batteries (one each fore, aft, port, and starboard). Artillery hits cause 2-12 hull points of <a href="#damage">damage</a> and will hole a ship below the waterline on any score of 10 or more hull points. A holed ship will sink in 3-18 <a href="#combat">combat</a> <a href="#turns">turns</a> (minutes) unless repairs are made.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="ramming">Ramming</h4>
                  <p>Medieval ships are not generally built for ramming but a faster ship may ram a slower ship in the side, circumstances permitting. The ramming ship sustains one hull die <a href="#damage">damage</a> while the rammed ship sustains half the rammer&#8217;s hull <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> (rounded down) in <a href="#damage">damage</a>. If 10 or more hull points are sustained the ship is holed below the waterline and will sink in 3-18 <a href="#turns">turns</a>. Meanwhile, boarding may ensue.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="melee_1">Melee</h4>
                  <p>When ships <a href="#ramming">ram</a>, grapple, or come along side for boarding the referee is advised to use the <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a> <a href="#scale">scale</a> (1&quot; to 10ft and one minute <a href="#turns">turns</a>) to resolve any hand-to-hand <a href="#combat">combat</a>. Ship deck plans can be used much as <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> maps for this purpose. Troops fleeing from <a href="#combat">combat</a> will only pitch themselves overboard in fair <a href="#weather">weather</a> near to land; otherwise they will surrender.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="swimming">Swimming</h3>
                  <p>Any player character who grew up on the coast or by a watercourse can swim, as can any non-player character who throws a 4-6 on a six-sided die. Swimming is at a rate of 6&quot; in ideal circumstances; otherwise 3&quot;. A character can swim for at most a single day after which he will <a href="#drowning">drown</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="drowning">Drowning</h3>
                  <p>Anyone pitched into the sea risks drowning. Half of any ship&#8217;s crew cannot <a href="#swimming">swim</a> and will automatically drown; otherwise, unarmored <a href="#men">men</a> who can <a href="#swimming">swim</a> will survive with a throw of 2-6 on a six-sided die if they immediately rid themselves of anything heavier than a <a href="#daggers">dagger</a>. Each heavier item retained increases the risk of drowning by 1 in 6. Leather and mail <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a> count for one and four items, respectively, and plate <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a> causes automatic drowning. During a <a href="#storms_1">storm</a> there is always a minimum of 3 chances in 6 of drowning. Survival indicates that the character has managed to remove his <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a> before drowning.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id="aerial-exploration">Aerial Exploration</h2>
                  <p>Should the players acquire winged mounts they can map <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> and ocean regions by aerial exploration.</p>
                  <p>The referee may also wish to include cloud top regions which can only be reached on the wing. The referee can use the random <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> tables to generate cloud top regions for aerial exploration. Hexes of open terrain should be read as vacant air, woods as islands of solid cloud, mountains as cloud piercing or floating peaks, desert as dangerously insubstantial islands of cloud, and swamp as perpetually stormy regions. Likewise, rivers should represent persistent currents, <a href="#fords">fords</a> should represent confluences of currents, and trails should represent navigable tunnels or air ways. The other features are as per the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> except that villages should be ignored.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="time-and-movement_2">Time and Movement</h3>
                  <p>Aerial exploration retains the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> exploration timescale of 1 <a href="#turns">turn</a> per day.</p>
                  <div id="table2_22"></div>
                  <p>There are two modes of travel on the wing: low and high altitude.</p>
                  <p>At low altitude it is possible to observe or remain in contact with ground-level activity including <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursuit</a> and <a href="#combat">combat</a>. However, at low altitude fliers must allow for hazards and turbulence and must weave routes around, between, or over terrain features.</p>
                  <p>At high altitude progress is unimpeded other than by the need to roost overnight; <a href="#movement-rates_1">movement rate</a> is generally double that achieved at low altitude.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="visibility_2">Visibility</h4>
                  <p>Distance to the horizon is <a href="#relatives">relative</a> to altitude. In clear <a href="#weather">weather</a> <a href="#visibility">visibility</a> is 2-6 hexagons (up to 36 miles) from low altitude, or 11-16 hexes (up to 100 miles) from a lofty mountain summit. However, poor <a href="#weather">weather</a> conditions and intervening mountains will severely restrict <a href="#visibility">visibility</a>. From a high altitude <a href="#visibility">visibility</a> is 11-16 hexes (up to 100 miles) in perfect <a href="#weather">weather</a>, but is usually limited by cloud cover.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="resting_2">Resting</h4>
                  <p>Flying creatures other than <a href="#elementals-air">air elementals</a> need to roost overnight (or during the day if they travel at night). Additionally, flying creatures other than <a href="#dragons">dragons</a> and <a href="#elementals-air">air elementals</a> require a full day of <a href="#resting">rest</a> after six days on the <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a>. <a href="#elementals-air">Air elementals</a> are tireless fliers, while <a href="#dragons">dragons</a> require a full week of sleep after six weeks of activity.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="weather_2">Weather</h3>
                  <p>Although travel by air is quick it is severely affected by poor <a href="#weather">weather</a>.</p>
                  <p>Weather conditions should be determined by the referee for each day of <a href="#aerial-exploration">aerial</a> exploration. Throw one six-sided die to determine which hex face the <a href="#strong-winds">wind</a> is blowing from and two <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> to determine <a href="#strong-winds">wind</a> <a href="#strength">strength</a>. <a href="#aerial-exploration">Aerial</a> travel can be dangerous in strong <a href="#strong-winds">winds</a> and <a href="#storms_1">storms</a>; travelers risk being dashed into obstacles, struck by lightning or flying debris, and so on.</p>

At low altitude these are likely to be on the ground. If these are discovered at high altitude they could be levitating towers, built upon cloud banks, suspended by squadrons of hot air balloons, or whatever else the referee desires.

                  <p>Surprise occurs in the air (as it does in the <a href="#underworld-exploration">underworld</a>) with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die. If the players are surprised their enemies will typically come at them from upwind or above, emerge suddenly out of clouds or rain squalls, or emerge from the dazzling glare of the sun.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="encounter-distance_3">Encounter Distance</h4>
                  <p>If either party is surprised an <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> will begin at 10-60 yards distance and the surprised party will be unable to respond for one <a href="#turns">turn</a>; otherwise, an <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> will begin at 40-240 yards distance. <a href="#melee_2">Melee</a> range is 1&quot; (10 yards) as it is in the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a>. Airborne artillery range is typically 300 yards.</p>

Excepting <a href="#elementals-air">air elementals</a>, larger creatures are clumsier fliers than are smaller creatures. Climbing is slow and diving is fast.</p>
                  <p>When air-to-air <a href="#combat">combat</a> occurs, the referee should use the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a> <a href="#scale">scale</a> (1&quot; to 10 yards and one minute <a href="#turns">turns</a>) to resolve maneuvering and <a href="#missile-fire">missile</a> fire as the protagonists engage.

                  <p>Large creatures can bombard ground targets by dropping rocks, logs, bodies, or similar <a href="#missile-fire">missiles</a> from above. These are treated as artillery attacks.</p>
                  <p>Missile fire from the air is always considered to be at long range and, against <a href="#aerial-exploration">aerial</a> targets, attack rolls are penalized by &#8722;4.</p>
                  <p>A <a href="#mounted-combat">mounted</a> <a href="#heroic-types">heroic-type</a> is subject to <a href="#missile-fire">missile</a> fire only on a six-sided die throw of 5-6; otherwise his mount is subject to that <a href="#missile-fire">missile</a> fire. Should a rider be hit he is unhorsed with a throw of 6 on a six-sided die and will <a href="#falling">fall</a>. Otherwise, a hit to his mount will maim a critical flight muscle with a throw of 6 on a six-sided die and cause it to crash to the ground.</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="melee_2">Melee</h4>
                  <p>Aerial melee attacks are made in passing clashes at a range of 1&quot; (10 yards) with combatants being disengaged after each pass. Should a combatant lose the <a href="#initiative">initiative</a> he is unable to riposte that <a href="#turns">turn</a> unless his <a href="#speed">speed</a> and heading match his opponent&#8217;s, or the combatants are otherwise held together.</p>

                  <p>A wealthy character may wish to construct a <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> such as a <a href="#keep">keep</a>, tower, castle, or whatever is affordable.

Depending upon the character&#8217;s <a href="#alignment">alignment</a>, <a href="#charisma">charisma</a>, and political prospects, such permission may not always be forthcoming.</p>
                  <p>Monsters must be cleared from within three hexes (18 miles) of the site before any construction can commence. Once a fortification has been established, however, the surrounds will remain clear of <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> so long as they are patrolled satisfactorily.</p>
                  <p>The region within three hexes of a <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> (37 hexes total) will typically contain 2-8 villages of 100-400 inhabitants; these and other features can be determined by the referee using the random <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> hex tables. If the occupier of a <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> is at least 9th level he is entitled to collect 1 gp per month from each inhabitant for their protection. <a href="#the-cleric">Clerics</a> may collect an additional 1 gp per month for spiritual donations where alms are provided and services conducted.</p>
                  <p>These revenues may be used by the player to swell his personal treasury or to further his fledgling realm with roads, bridges, fortifications, inns, churches, animal husbandry, or whatever else. How these activities will influence the character&#8217;s reputation and his political prospects is for the referee to decide.</p>
                  <p>Below are the costs of common structures though any variation in size should adjust costs proportionately.</p>

                  <p>Strongholds may need to defend themselves or the surrounding territory from hostile or ambitious neighbors. Political intrigues, sieges, and field battles are all possible. While the <a href="#combat">combat</a> rules herein can resolve actions involving large bodies of troops, the referee may desire to employ purpose-made wargaming rules for full-<a href="#scale">scale</a> fantasy battles. Suitable rules for these engagements include &#8220;Chainmail&#8221; (1971), &#8220;De Bellis Fantasticus&#8212;Here There Be <a href="#dragons">Dragons</a>&#8221; (1998), and &#8220;The Book of War&#8221; (2011).</p>

                  <h3 id="artifacts">Artifacts</h3>
                  <p>Super powerful magic items aligned toward law, neutrality, or chaos might exist at the referee&#8217;s option. These potentially game-altering objects are known as artifacts and should be handled by the referee with great care.</p>
                  <p>Artifacts are unique, <a href="#the-campaign">campaign</a> specific objects that have a <a href="#purpose">purpose</a> and a history. An artifact could be a throne, an extra-dimensional gate, a crown, a suit of mechanized <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a>, an enchanted ship, a sword of seven shards, or anything else the referee desires. They will be the subject of <a href="#researching-new-spells">research</a> and controversy among the wisest and may also be known through folklore to the common <a href="#men">man</a>.</p>
                  <p>Whatever its nature, an artifact is impervious to ordinary magic. <a href="#anti-magic-shield">Anti-magic shield</a>, <a href="#remove-curse">remove curse</a>, <a href="#dispel-magic">dispel magic</a>, <a href="#dispel-evil">dispel evil</a>, and so on are completely ineffective. Moreover, an artifact is almost completely indestructible. There is typically only one specific way to destroy an artifact which invariably involves a great <a href="#quest">quest</a> to some faraway and dangerous place.</p>
                  <p>Consequences for meddling with an artifact of differing <a href="#alignment">alignment</a> should be severe. Death, insanity, extra-dimensional imprisonment, 10-60 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>, loss of 1-6 experience levels, or similar would not be unreasonable. The power imbued when employing an artifact appropriately should be equally astonishing and this matter is left entirely to the referee&#8217;s imagination...</p>

                  <p>There are countless other <a href="#creating-a-world">worlds</a> to explore that might be reached by magic or by other ingenuity.

                  <p>Should the players reach other <a href="#creating-a-world">worlds</a> these should be remarkably different from our own. The assumed natural laws of gravity, time, <a href="#space-required">space</a>, temperature, inflammability, <a href="#scale">scale</a>, and so on should not all apply. In this regard the wealth of science fiction and fantasy literature can be a great inspiration to the referee.</p>

                  <h2 id="monsters_2">Monsters</h2>
                  <p>Monsters are the principal challenge that players will face in their adventures. They include all the genuine horrors of the <a href="#underworld-exploration">underworld</a> such as <a href="#trolls">trolls</a>, <a href="#vampires">vampires</a>, and <a href="#dragons">dragons</a>, as well as all the non-player characters of the <a href="#creating-a-world">world</a>. Every character that is not run by a player is a monster&#8212;even the good townsfolk and the players&#8217; <a href="#hirelings">hirelings</a>.</p>
                  <p>It is clear then that not all monsters are harmful to the players. Some are quite benign and may even be helpful. Others are completely disinterested in the players so long as they don&#8217;t get in the way, while yet others are villainous threats that will seek to slay, capture, or waylay the players. A monster&#8217;s initial disposition toward the players is determined by a <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">reaction</a> check and its <a href="#alignment">alignment</a>. This characteristic is a one word summary of any monster&#8217;s stance in the eternal struggle between law, chaos, and neutrality.</p>

                  <h5 id="number-appearing-and-number-in">Number Appearing and Number in</h5>
                  <p>Lair are the numbers of <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> typically encountered outside of or in their lair, respectively. A + indicates the possibility of leader-types and/or accompanying <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a>. The number of <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> appearing outside the lair is appropriate for 4-6 characters whose experience level is equal to the <a href="#monsters_2">monster&#8217;s</a> number of <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a>. The referee can <a href="#scale">scale</a> these figures for smaller or larger groups or as desired.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="ac">AC</h5>
                  <p>is for <a href="#melee">armor class</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="movement-rates_1">Movement Rates</h5>
                  <p>are given in inches per <a href="#turns">turn</a>. The first figure denotes the normal ground rate. If a secondary rate appears it denotes the flying, <a href="#swimming">swimming</a>, burrowing, or climbing rate as per the <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> description.</p>

                  <h5 id="hd">HD</h5>
                  <p>lists the number of <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a> with any adjustment to <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> being applied after the given number of six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> have been thrown and summed.</p>

                  <h5 id="lair-nearby">Lair Nearby</h5>
                  <p>is the percentage chance that any encountered <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> will be from a nearby lair. &#8220;Nearby&#8221; is <a href="#relatives">relative</a> to the <a href="#monsters_2">monster&#8217;s</a> usual mode of locomotion. Whether the lair is easy or difficult to locate is for the referee to determine.</p>

                  <h5 id="treasure-type">Treasure Type</h5>
                  <p>is for determining what <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> will be present in the lair. A * indicates the possibility of additional <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> as per the <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> description.</p>

                  <h5 id="alignment_1">Alignment</h5>
                  <p>L is for lawful, N is for neutral, and C is for chaotic. Some <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> can be of any <a href="#alignment">alignment</a> (<a href="#men">men</a> being among these) and others can be either of two <a href="#alignment">alignments</a> (<a href="#elves_1">elves</a> and <a href="#kobolds">kobolds</a> being among these). In all these cases any individual is always of exactly one <a href="#alignment">alignment</a>.</p>

                  <h2 id="explanation-of-monsters">Explanation of Monsters</h2>
                  <p>Wherever special melee <a href="#damage">damage</a> is detailed it is applicable to <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a> only. However, against <a href="#normal-types">normal-types</a>, <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> throw one attack roll as a 1 <a href="#hit-dice">hit die</a> <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> for each of their own <a href="#hit-dice">hit die</a>, with each successful attack roll causing 1-6 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>.</p>
                  <p>Monster <a href="#saving-throws">saving throws</a> are as the most appropriate player-type with as many experience levels as the <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> has <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a>. For example, an <a href="#androids">android</a> would save as a 2nd level <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a>, a <a href="#trolls">troll</a> would save as a 6th level <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-man</a>, and so on. A <a href="#gothrogs">gothrog</a> would save as a 10th level <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-man</a>/10th level <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a>, using whichever category is more favorable.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="androids">Androids</h5>
                  <p>are artificial <a href="#men">men</a>. They often have superior qualities such as health, grace, comeliness, or education, but are otherwise indistinguishable save for the color of their blood. Some individuals possess mind powers equivalent to magic use of up to the 4th experience level (throw a six-sided die and subtract 2 for each android&#8212;a result less than 1 indicating no tangible mind powers); otherwise, they function as do ordinary <a href="#men">men</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="ants-giant">Ants, Giant</h5>
                  <p>are 2-3ft long. They are industrious tunnelers and gatherers that occur in great colonies. Outside the lair only the soldier types will be encountered. Within the lair two-thirds of any ants encountered are 1 <a href="#hit-dice">hit die</a> workers that will not attack unless provoked. The remainder are soldiers that will attack anything that obstructs the business of the colony. A nest always has a 10 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a> queen ant who is immobile and non-aggressive. <a href="#giants">Giant</a> ants will never flee from their nest unless the queen is slain.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="apes">Apes</h5>
                  <p>are generally non-aggressive but are extremely strong. They will climb trees for refuge but if provoked they can strike for 2-7 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="basilisks">Basilisks</h5>
                  <p>are large, slow, eight-legged reptiles whose gaze or touch will petrify any living creature that fails to save <a href="#paralysis-and-petrification">versus petrification</a>. If it is tricked into seeing its own reflection in a mirror, a basilisk will likewise be petrified.</p>

                  <h5 id="bats">Bats</h5>
                  <p>roost underground in great numbers during the day. They are mostly harmless to <a href="#man-types">man-types</a> but if a colony is startled and takes to the wing in a confined <a href="#space-required">space</a> they will create confusion. A flapping cloud of <a href="#bats-giant">bats</a> will obscure sight and possibly extinguish torches, cause <a href="#equipment">equipment</a> to be dropped, or cause spell <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">casting</a> to be interrupted.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="bats-giant">Bats, Giant</h5>
                  <p>are black as night and so silent on the wing that they will <a href="#surprise">surprise</a> their prey with a throw of 3 or more on a six-sided die. If their prey resists they will shriek, causing <a href="#normal-types">normal-types</a> to cover their ears for one <a href="#turns">turn</a> rather than fight.</p>

                  <h5 id="bears">Bears</h5>
                  <p>are omnivorous but favor meat. They have rather poor eyesight but an excellent sense of smell and can scent food from miles away. They can be aggressive hunters and are very powerful. They cause 3-8 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> or, if an attack roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more or is a 20 in any case, 4-14 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>.</p>

                  <h5 id="beetles-giant">Beetles, Giant</h5>
                  <p>are of various sorts but are invariably hungry and can eat virtually any organic matter. They occur underground and in forests and can tunnel through soft earth. They do not hear or see well and rely on their sensitivity to vibrations and smell.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="a-black-pudding">A Black Pudding</h5>
                  <p>is an amorphous black blob which <a href="#time-and-movement_2">moves</a> about a <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> scavenging the leavings of other inhabitants. Due to its coloration and shapelessness it is very difficult to spot in dim <a href="#light_2">light</a> or shadows. It is susceptible to fire but invulnerable to cold. Lightning and slashing attacks will divide it into smaller parts without causing harm. Contact with a black pudding will dissolve wood and metal <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a> in one <a href="#turns">turn</a>. Flesh is likewise dissolved suffering 3-18 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> per <a href="#turns">turn</a>. Stone, however, is impervious. It can <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a> along walls, floors, and ceilings without difficulty and can squeeze through tiny openings including cracks in stonework and under <a href="#doors">doors</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="boars">Boars</h5>
                  <p>are wild pigs that occur in forests and on plains. They are frequently hunted for sport but are extremely tough; they always make one more attack roll after being reduced to 0 or fewer <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a>. Every other boar encountered will be a sounder and if these young are attacked the adults will always attack and will absolutely not flee.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="boars-giant">Boars, Giant</h5>
                  <p>are similar to regular <a href="#boars">boars</a> but for their great size and aggressive demeanor. They will attack anyone who enters their territory causing 2-12 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>. They will never retreat and will always make one more attack roll after being reduced to 0 or fewer <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="cave-bears">Cave Bears</h5>
                  <p>are enormous carnivorous <a href="#bears">bears</a> that are always hungry. They have rather poor eyesight but an excellent sense of smell and can scent food from miles away. They are aggressive hunters and are extremely powerful. They cause 1-11 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> or, if an attack roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more or is a 20 in any case, 3-18 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>. Cave bears will always make one more attack roll after being reduced to 0 or fewer <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="cavemen">Cavemen</h5>
                  <p>are large but primitive Neanderthal types who are otherwise similar to <a href="#men">men</a>. They fight with crude <a href="#axes">axes</a>, hammers, and clubs, but suffer a &#8722;1 adjustment to <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> checks and have little <a href="#treasures">treasure</a>. Leader-types are always <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a> but never possess magic items.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="centaurs">Centaurs</h5>
                  <p>are <a href="#horses">horse</a>-<a href="#men">men</a> having the body of a <a href="#horses">horse</a> and the torso of a human. They have normal human <a href="#intelligence">intelligence</a> and dwell in secluded glens and valleys in deep forests. Centaurs equip themselves with <a href="#spears">spears</a> (25%), swords (25%), or clubs (50%) and <a href="#armor-and-shields">shields</a> with half carrying short <a href="#bows">bows</a> in addition. Moreover, a centaur warrior can has two attack rolls each <a href="#turns">turn</a>, once each with his weaponry and hooves. A centaur lair is much as a small human village having two mares and two foals for every warrior stallion present. Mares have one attack roll each <a href="#turns">turn</a> only under duress and foals are non-combative.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="centipedes-giant-and-large">Centipedes, Giant and Large</h5>
                  <p>are found almost anywhere and are aggressive hunters. Large specimens are up to 1ft long, while the <a href="#giants">giant</a> types are up to 10ft long and have a hard, armored head but a relatively soft body. Both sorts <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a> along walls and ceilings at normal <a href="#speed">speed</a>. The bite of either causes paralysis although a <a href="#saving-throws">saving throw</a> is allowed and is at +4 in the case of large centipedes.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="chimeras">Chimeras</h5>
                  <p>are fearsome three-headed <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> with great <a href="#bats-giant">bat</a>-like wings, the forequarters of a <a href="#lions">lion</a>, the hindquarters of a goat, and the heads of goat, <a href="#lions">lion</a>, and <a href="#dragons">dragon</a>. A chimera can use its <a href="#breath-weapon">breath weapon</a> or engage in <a href="#combat">combat</a>. The <a href="#dragons">dragon</a> head breathes a 6&quot; long 2&quot; wide cone of fire that deals 3-18 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>, although a successful <a href="#saving-throws">saving throw</a> <a href="#breath-weapon">versus breath weapons</a> will reduce this by half. In <a href="#combat">combat</a> a chimera has three attack rolls each <a href="#turns">turn</a> against <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a> enemies; the goat head butting or goring, the <a href="#lions">lion</a> head biting or rending with its paws, and the <a href="#dragons">dragon</a> head biting.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="cockatrices">Cockatrices</h5>
                  <p>are reptilian-fowl with <a href="#bats-giant">bat</a>-like wings. The merest touch of its tail feathers will petrify any living thing (other than a cockatrice) that fails to save <a href="#paralysis-and-petrification">versus petrification</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="crabs-giant">Crabs, Giant</h5>
                  <p>occur underwater, in coastal estuaries, and in swamps. They have hard, armored shells and if an attack roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more, or is a 20 in any case, they cause 1-11 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> <a href="#damage">damage</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="crocodiles">Crocodiles</h5>
                  <p>are voracious reptiles found in rivers and swamps of warm regions. They are difficult to spot when floating half-submerged in water and will often attack by <a href="#surprise">surprise</a>. If an attack roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more a crocodile will drag its victim back into the water where it will roll over and over until the victim is drowned. Crocodiles are lazy and will not <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursue</a> more than one <a href="#turns">turn</a> out of water.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="crocodiles-giant">Crocodiles, Giant</h5>
                  <p>are thrice the size of their ordinary cousins but otherwise similar. An attack causes 2-12 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> and any attack roll that exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more swallows a <a href="#men">man</a>-sized victim whole. They are difficult to spot as they float half-submerged in water and they can overturn boats and rafts. A <a href="#giants">giant</a> <a href="#crocodiles">crocodile</a> can be rammed by larger ships, possibly slaying the <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> but also capsizing the boat (check separately for each).</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="cyborgs">Cyborgs</h5>
                  <p>were once <a href="#men">men</a> but are now mostly machines; inhumane and evil. They can occur in large numbers and aim to sweep across a population assimilating all <a href="#man-types">man-types</a> into cyborgs. They are cruelly strong and deal 3-8 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> on a hit, need never check <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a>, and will never give up a <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursuit</a> so long as the quarry is in sight.</p>

                  <h5 id="cyclopes">Cyclopes</h5>
                  <p>are 20ft tall <a href="#giants">giants</a> with but one large eye which is the cause of poor depth perception and a &#8722;2 adjustment on all attack rolls. They dwell in forlorn, out of the way ruins, islands, or undersea caves where they seldom <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a> others. They are skilled <a href="#at-least-one-smith">smiths</a> and should a player offer a useful gift and get a positive <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">reaction</a> the cyclopes may offer magical <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a> in return. A cyclops does battle with a huge club and deals 6-21 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> and can hurl rocks up to 20&quot; for 2-12 <a href="#damage">damage</a>. They especially prize gold and their <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> hoard will always contain an additional 2,000-5,000 gp.</p>

                  <h3 id="dinosaurs">Dinosaurs</h3>
                  <p>Dinosaurs are great, prehistoric <a href="#lizards-giant-and-large">lizards</a> and can be fearsome enemies. The largest predators are few but can swallow <a href="#men">man</a>-sized victims whole while the smaller types occur in hunting packs. Herbivores of all sizes appear in herds. None of them covets <a href="#treasures">treasure</a>.</p>

                  <div class="lpad lborder">
                    <h5 id="dinosaurs-brontosaurs">Dinosaurs, Brontosaurs</h5>
                    <p>  are among the largest creatures walking on land. They are up to 80ft long, 20ft tall at the shoulder, and can weigh over 30 tons. They spend their time grazing the vegetation of the great plains and swamplands. Fortunately, they are peaceful herbivores and unlikely to attack unless provoked. The chief danger they present is from crushing, barging, or stampeding ahead of predators or fire. Hits deal 3-18 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> due to their immense mass.</p>
                    <h5 id="dinosaurs-deinonychus">Dinosaurs, Deinonychus</h5>
                    <p>  include any of the relatively small pack hunting carnivores up to 5ft high and 10ft long. They are quick and cunning and inclined to stalk prey, only attacking at the optimal moment. They will not give up a <a href="#evasion-and-pursuit">pursuit</a> while their prey remains in sight.</p>
                    <h5 id="dinosaurs-mosasaurs">Dinosaurs, Mosasaurs</h5>

They are of six types: white, black, green, blue, red, and golden and have the following characteristics:</p>
                  <div id="table3_2"></div>
                  <p>White <a href="#dragons">dragons</a> are the least intelligent sort and have the usual 20% chance of knowing the common tongue and no possibility of magic use. <a href="#dragons-golden">Golden dragons</a> are the most intelligent sort and they always know the common tongue and always have the use of magic <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a>.

                  <p>All <a href="#dragons">dragons</a> have six life stages: hatchling, young, adult, mature, old, and ancient. The size of a <a href="#dragons">dragon&#8217;s</a> <a href="#breath-weapon">breath weapon</a> is determined according to its life stage, as is the possibility of a <a href="#dragons">dragon</a> being asleep if encountered in its lair. Note that even a wakeful <a href="#dragons">dragon</a> may appear to be sleeping.</p>
                  <div id="table3_3"></div>
                  <p>All <a href="#dragons">dragons</a> can sense hidden and invisible creatures within 6&quot;.

                  <p>Should a <a href="#dragons">dragon</a> be sleeping the characters may, if great caution is employed, approach without waking it. If this is successfully accomplished a single <a href="#turns">turn</a> of <a href="#surprise">surprise</a> attacks is allowed at +2 to hit.

                  <p>are encountered they will be related individuals of the same type. A pair of <a href="#dragons">dragons</a> could be siblings, mother and daughter, or a mated pair as appropriate for their age category. Hatchlings and young <a href="#dragons">dragons</a> will be the offspring of adults present. If these are attacked, the adults will immediately use their <a href="#breath-weapon">breath weapons</a> against the offender. If either adult of a mated pair is attacked, its mate will retaliate at +4 to hit the following <a href="#turns">turn</a> or for the remainder of the <a href="#combat">combat</a> if its mate is slain.</p>

A <a href="#attacking-to-subdue">subdued</a> <a href="#dragons">dragon</a> will serve so long as its master remains in a commanding position but will otherwise attempt to escape or slay him. A <a href="#attacking-to-subdue">subdued</a> <a href="#dragons">dragon</a> can be sold into servitude on the open market for 500-1,000 gp per <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit point</a> it has&#8212;although the player may have difficulty finding an appropriate buyer.</p>

                  <p>All elementals, no matter the <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a> or type, must be controlled by the summoner. If the summoner&#8217;s concentration is broken for any reason the elemental will cease whatever it is doing, <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a> at its best <a href="#speed">speed</a>, and attempt to kill him. Anyone between the elemental and its summoner will be attacked and everyone else will be ignored. Once control has been relinquished there is no way to regain it. The elemental will attack until it or its target is destroyed and immediately return to its home dimension.</p>

For every 40 elves encountered there will be a leader-type with 2-4 <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-man</a> levels and 2-6 <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> levels.

                  <p>appear much as the sculptural depictions in gothic architecture. They can remain perfectly still indefinitely and are indistinguishable from ordinary statues when so perched.

                  <p>is a cube-shaped, transparent scavenger that shapes itself to fit <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> corridors up to 10ft by 10ft wide and <a href="#time-and-movement_2">moves</a> about sweeping them clean. It picks up and absorbs everything from rocks and carrion to living things and <a href="#treasures">treasure</a>, which it is unable to digest. Thus, these scavengers carry a miscellany of durable items (coins, gems, <a href="#daggers">daggers</a>, <a href="#magical-helms">helms</a>, and so on) suspended in their transparent innards. Contact with a gelatinous cube causes paralysis unless a successful <a href="#saving-throws">saving throw</a> is made, and thereafter causes 1-6 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> per <a href="#turns">turn</a> as the flesh is digested.

                  <p>Gothrogs carry great, flaming, <a href="#magic-swords">magic swords</a> and fiery whips and can attack with either or both each <a href="#turns">turn</a>. Should a gothrog employ both weapons it can target two opponents, causing 2-12 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> to each. If it employs only one weapon it does so at +2 to hit. The flaming sword causes 3-18 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>. The whip causes only 1-6 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>, but entangles the target so the gothrog can drag him unto itself, where upon it will immolate and cause an additional 2-12 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> to everybody within 1&quot;.</p>

It begins to eat through flesh, wood, and metal (but not stone) after one <a href="#turns">turn</a> of contact, transmuting these into green slime. It cannot be physically scraped off so anything it comes into contact with must be discarded immediately. It is impervious to lightning and physical blows but is harmed by cold and fire.

                  <p>is a creature from the null-dimensions which can be conjured to the material <a href="#creating-a-world">world</a> by powerful magic. It is indistinguishable from air without the benefit of a <a href="#detect-invisibility">detect invisibility</a> or a <a href="#true-seeing">true seeing</a> spell. It is a faultless tracker and, if encountered in the material <a href="#creating-a-world">world</a>, an invisible stalker will be single-mindedly preoccupied with whatever mission it is carrying out.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="a-juggernaut">A Juggernaut</h5>
                  <p>is an incredibly massive creature of solid ore, though whether it is self-willed or magically motivated is unknown. These behemoths have only ever been sighted individually and can take any form; a great armored knight, a mammoth, and a rhinoceros have all been reported. A juggernaut is so massive that it is impelled upon huge stone rollers with anything falling in its path being crushed utterly beneath it.</p>
                  <p>Regardless of its form a juggernaut always has a massive dark jewel affixed to it; between the eyes, in the chest, or atop a <a href="#magical-helms">helm</a>, <a href="#staves-and-wands">staff</a>, or sword, and so on. The jewel glows with an eerie <a href="#light_2">light</a> and can <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">cast</a> out a <a href="#slaying-spell">slaying spell</a> each <a href="#turns">turn</a> or an improved <a href="#hold-person">hold person</a> spell which will affect 2-12 <a href="#man-types">man-types</a> who save at &#8722;2 or a single <a href="#man-types">man-type</a> who saves at &#8722;6. Unfortunates so held will soon be crushed beneath the juggernaut. If the jewel is somehow removed from a juggernaut it has no magical properties but is worth 20,000-120,000 gp.</p>
                  <p>If it comes to blows a juggernaut deals a crushing 5-30 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>. It is impervious to most magical attacks and can only be harmed by magical weapons of +3 or better quality. A juggernaut need never check <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> and cannot be <a href="#attacking-to-subdue">subdued</a>.</p>

Each fighting kobold carries coins worth 1-6 gp with him, even outside the lair. Their lair will be a marshy cave complex containing as many non-combatants as combatants as well as a kobold king and 5-30 bodyguards who fight as 1+1 and 1 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a> <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a>, respectively. The lair is 50% likely to contain an additional 3-24 <a href="#crocodiles">crocodiles</a> and 2-12 <a href="#lizards-giant-and-large">giant lizards</a> (check separately for each).

They arm themselves with <a href="#daggers">daggers</a> and short <a href="#bows">bows</a> and always attack by <a href="#surprise">surprise</a> unless they are detected by magical means.

A purple worm causes 2-12 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> and has a deadly venomous stringer in the tail but the huge maw is the main weapon; if a bite attack roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more, or is a 20 in any case, a <a href="#men">man</a>-sized or smaller target will be swallowed whole. Swallowed targets will be unconscious within 3 <a href="#turns">turns</a>, slain within 6 <a href="#turns">turns</a>, and the body unrecoverable after 12 <a href="#turns">turns</a>. The interior gullet is AC 9 but can be attacked only by <a href="#daggers">dagger</a> or knife; at least 12 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> must be caused to cut a way out.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="rats-giant">Rats, Giant</h5>
                  <p>occur in plague proportions underground, squeezing through tiny gaps and tunnels in the earth and stone work. They cause only 1-3 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> but any hit can transmit a debilitating disease to <a href="#man-types">man-types</a> who fail to save <a href="#poison">versus poison</a> at +4 on the die (a single <a href="#saving-throws">saving throw</a> being required per <a href="#wilderness-encounters">encounter</a>). Unless commanded to fight by a <a href="#vampires">vampire</a> or <a href="#lycanthropes">lycanthrope</a> they have &#8722;2 <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> and will flee from fire.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="robots">Robots</h5>
                  <p>are complex metal automatons with unfathomable electronic brains. They are self motivating and semi-intelligent and can be negotiated with to some extent. They are usually set on a &#8220;program&#8221; from which they will never waiver. Robots are cruelly strong and will strike for 3-8 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>. Many can <a href="#fly">fly</a> by one means or another and the remainder are equipped with a disintegration ray which can be fired up to 6&quot; thrice per day. A successful <a href="#saving-throws">saving throw</a> <a href="#wands-and-rays">versus wands</a> is required to avoid the beam. Robots cannot be <a href="#attacking-to-subdue">subdued</a> and need never check <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="rocs">Rocs</h5>
                  <p>are gargantuan raptors that prey on cattle, <a href="#horses">horses</a>, and even elephants. Their eyesight is peerless and they always spot hidden (but not invisible) <a href="#man-types">man-types</a>, even from high altitude. The largest rocs are so fearsome that <a href="#normal-types">normal</a> <a href="#man-types">man-types</a> must check <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> if attacked. Rocs lair in remote, mountainous aeries that are difficult to approach except on the wing. Those found in the lair will be of mixed life stages and there is a 50% chance that there will also be 1-6 unhatched eggs or fledglings.</p>
                  <div id="table3_12"></div>
                  <p>Eggs and fledglings can be trained to serve as mounts if they can be captured. If the nest contains these, the mature <a href="#rocs">rocs</a> will attack anyone who approaches and never check <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a>; otherwise, the mature <a href="#rocs">rocs</a> will tolerate lawful characters and possibly even help them. Chaotic sorts can expect only a hostile <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">reaction</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="sabre-toothed-tigers">Sabre Toothed Tigers</h5>
                  <p>are the great cats of the Pliocene epoch, capable of hunting down <a href="#dinosaurs">dinosaurs</a>. They are half as large again as ordinary <a href="#tigers">tigers</a> and every bit as canny and agile. They cause 2-9 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> or, if an attack roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more or is a 20 in any case, 4-14 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="salamanders">Salamanders</h5>
                  <p>are fire-types possessing high <a href="#intelligence">intelligence</a>, the upper body of a <a href="#men">man</a>, and the hind section of a great serpent. They employ <a href="#spears">spears</a> and pole arms and can be found in lava fields and environs of intense heat. Their touch causes inflammables to combust and 1-6 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> to non-fire creatures. In <a href="#melee_2">melee</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a> the upper body is AC 5 while the serpent section is AC 3. Opponents who are not fire-types suffer an additional 1-6 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> with each hit. However, if an attack roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more, a salamander instead constricts with its burning tail for 2-12 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> (plus 1-6 additional <a href="#damage">damage</a> to non-fire creatures). They are themselves invulnerable to fire and <a href="#normal-weapons">normal weaponry</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="scorpions-giant">Scorpions, Giant</h5>
                  <p>are extremely aggressive hunters of <a href="#horses">horse</a>-sized proportions. They sense things mainly through vibration in the earth and will always attack anything that approaches. An attack roll that exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more, or is a 20 in any case, indicates a hit by the venomous stinger, which is fatal unless a <a href="#saving-throws">saving throw</a> <a href="#poison">versus poison</a> is successful; otherwise, it is assumed to be a pincer attack that deals 3-8 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="sea-monsters">Sea Monsters</h5>
                  <p>include the largest sea serpents, the whale-like leviathan (which has reportedly been mistaken for an island), and the many-tentacled kraken (which is confined to a null dimension unless it is called forth by an evil high priest to devour shipping and seaports). These exist principally as deadly perils to be avoided.</p>
                  <p>If the players insist on rousing sea <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> to <a href="#combat">combat</a>, sea serpents will cause 2-12 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> and swallow <a href="#men">man</a>-sized or smaller targets whole as per <a href="#purple-worms">purple worms</a> and can encircle longboats and smaller ships within their coils and destroy them in 1-6 <a href="#turns">turns</a>. The kraken can capsize any ship in 1-2 <a href="#turns">turns</a> or else deliver 1-6 attack rolls versus <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a>/ <a href="#superheroic-types">superheroic</a> enemies, each dealing 3-18 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>. The leviathan can capsize 1-3 ships in near proximity in a single <a href="#turns">turn</a> or swallow a single ship whole in its vast maw&#8212;destroying the <a href="#oared-vessels">vessel</a> and delivering 4-24 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> to everyone aboard as it swallows them.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="shadows">Shadows</h5>
                  <p>are bleak incorporeal spirits that hunger for the life energy of living things and drain 1-4 points of <a href="#strength">strength</a> on a hit. They are impervious to <a href="#normal-weapons">normal weaponry</a> unless it is silvered, but magical weapons will do them double <a href="#damage">damage</a>. Any <a href="#man-types">man-type</a> reduced to nil <a href="#strength">strength</a> by a shadow is slain and will arise on the following night as a shadow. <a href="#strength">Strength</a> <a href="#becoming-lost">lost</a> is otherwise recovered at 1 point per hour.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="skeletons">Skeletons</h5>
                  <p>are mindless undead brought forth by a <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> or <a href="#the-anti-cleric">anti-cleric</a> to serve some wicked purpose. These can carry <a href="#armor-and-shields">shields</a> or wear <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a>, or both, which would improve AC to 7 or 6, respectively. They are unaffected by <a href="#normal-missiles">normal missiles</a>, require no sustenance, and need never check <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="snakes-giant-and-large">Snakes, Giant and Large</h5>
                  <p>are encountered almost anywhere. Large snakes are up to 10ft long but are generally non-aggressive unless hunting or provoked; they are 50% likely to be venomous. <a href="#giants">Giant</a> snakes are more aggressive and are of two sorts: vipers and constrictors. Vipers slither silently and are deadly venomous. Constrictors are non-venomous and their bite bite deals only 1-2 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>. However, if attacking by <a href="#surprise">surprise</a> or an attack roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more, a constrictor instead encircles its target, crushing <a href="#man-types">man-types</a> for 2-12 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> per <a href="#turns">turn</a>. Constrictor-types can also be encountered at sea and are capable of encircling and destroying small boats within their coils in 1-6 <a href="#turns">turns</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="spectres">Spectres</h5>
                  <p>are malevolent, incorporeal spirits. They can <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a> through walls, ceilings, and floors and are impervious to <a href="#normal-weapons">normal weaponry</a>. Their attack is a withering grasp that drains two experience levels on a hit. A <a href="#man-types">man-type</a> slain by a spectre will arise the following night as a spectre under the control of the <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> that destroyed him. Any additional spectres encountered will be thralls of this sort.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="spiders-giant-and-large">Spiders, Giant and Large</h5>
                  <p>occur commonly in <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeons</a>. Large spiders are the size of a <a href="#men">man&#8217;s</a> hand and can scurry over floors, walls, and ceilings equally. Their bite is venomous but a <a href="#saving-throws">saving throw</a> <a href="#poison">versus poison</a> is allowed at +2. <a href="#giants">Giant</a> spiders are true horrors up to <a href="#horses">horse</a>-sized. Their bite is deadly venomous and they are <a href="#web">web</a> builders&#8212;these being equal to a <a href="#web">web</a> spell in <a href="#strength">strength</a>. They prefer to wait patiently in ambush and attack unwary victims. They will flee to a dark retreat if faced by superior opposition.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="squid-giant">Squid, Giant</h5>
                  <p>are voracious deep sea predators who will occasionally come to the surface to grapple and capsize passing <a href="#oared-vessels">vessels</a>. They make 1-6 attack rolls each <a href="#turns">turn</a> against <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a>/<a href="#superheroic-types">superheroic</a> enemies with their numerous tentacles. If seriously challenged they can expel a cloud of black ink and flee backwards at triple pace for three <a href="#turns">turns</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="thulls">Thulls</h5>
                  <p>are frightful humanoids similar to feral <a href="#hobgoblins">hobgoblins</a> in appearance but they are far more dangerous. A thull will regenerate 1 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">lost hit point</a> at the beginning of each <a href="#turns">turn</a> and a scratch from its black nails will cause paralysis for 1 <a href="#turns">turn</a> in <a href="#normal-types">normal</a> <a href="#man-types">man-types</a> (except <a href="#elves_1">elves</a> who are immune).</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="tigers">Tigers</h5>
                  <p>are great cats that occur in frigid to tropical woodlands. They are canny, agile, and superb hunters who will stalk prey patiently in order to attack by <a href="#surprise">surprise</a>. They can climb and <a href="#swimming">swim</a> and can leap 10ft upward or 40ft forward. They cause 2-7 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> or, if an attack roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more or is a 20 in any case, 2-12 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="titanotheres">Titanotheres</h5>
                  <p>are enormous herbivores that roam temperate plains and wetlands in herds. Normally peaceful, they will charge and trample anything that provokes them causing 3-18 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> due to their great size.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="a-titan">A Titan</h5>
                  <p>is a most handsome and civilized <a href="#giants">giant</a>. They are at least as intelligent as <a href="#men">men</a>, thrice as tall, and incredibly strong. They deliver 6-21 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> with their enormous weapons and have the use of any two <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> or <a href="#the-cleric">cleric</a> <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> of each spell level per day. A titan lair will contain an additional 3,000-18,000 gp.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="toads-giant">Toads, Giant</h5>
                  <p>will swallow <a href="#halflings_1">halflings</a> and smaller folk whole on any attack roll that exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more. They can hop 18&quot; every other <a href="#turns">turn</a>, <a href="#swimming">swim</a>, breath underwater, and are 50% likely to be venomous.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="treants">Treants</h5>
                  <p>are 20-30ft tall tree-<a href="#men">men</a>. They are guardians of the ancient forests they inhabit and have little interest in the affairs of short-lived races such as <a href="#men">men</a>. If roused they are dangerous enemies and will deal 2-12 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>. They are invulnerable to <a href="#normal-weapons">normal weapons</a> and suffer one-half <a href="#damage">damage</a> from magical weaponry other than <a href="#axes">axes</a> but are vulnerable to fire. Thrice per day a treant can awaken any other tree within 6&quot;. An awakened tree fights exactly as another treant without the ability to awaken others.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="trolls">Trolls</h5>
                  <p>are thin, loathsome humanoids with rubbery green skin. They would be tall if they were not always hunched over. They have <a href="#ogres">ogre</a>-like <a href="#strength">strength</a> but rarely employ anything more than tooth and claw so cause only 1-6 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a>. They regenerate 3 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">lost hit points</a> per <a href="#turns">turn</a>, beginning three <a href="#turns">turns</a> after injury, enabling even severed limbs to reattach or re-grow. The only way to permanently slay a troll is to burn its remains or immerse it in acid.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="unicorns">Unicorns</h5>
                  <p>are fierce, noble, magical steeds. They are reclusive creatures who will tolerate contact only with a maiden of pure heart. If she is a valorous warrior a unicorn may consent to serve as her steed, using its horn as a lance when it charges. A unicorn saves as a 12th level <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a>, is able to sense enemies within 24&quot;, and can <a href="#dimension-door">dimension door</a> up to 36&quot; once each day.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="vampires">Vampires</h5>
                  <p>are dreadful and intelligent blood-sucking undead. Fortunately, they must sleep during the day in a coffin containing soil from their homeland. They are impervious to <a href="#normal-weapons">normal weaponry</a> and regenerate 3 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> per <a href="#turns">turn</a> if injured. If reduced to 0 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> they are not slain but forced to assume <a href="#gaseous-form">gaseous form</a> and flee. They can <a href="#polymorph">polymorph</a> into <a href="#gaseous-form">gaseous form</a> or a <a href="#bats-giant">giant bat</a> at will and can call forth and command 10-80 <a href="#bats-giant">bats</a>, 2-12 <a href="#rats-giant">giant rats</a>, or 1-10 <a href="#wolves">wolves</a>.</p>
                  <p>Any <a href="#man-types">man-type</a> enduring eye contact with a vampire is subject to a <a href="#charm-person">charm person</a> spell with a &#8722;2 adjustment to the <a href="#saving-throws">saving throw</a>. Once a victim is charmed the vampire can bite at the neck with impunity, draining two experience levels per <a href="#turns">turn</a> of gorging. Any <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a>/<a href="#superheroic-types">superheroic</a> <a href="#man-types">man-type</a> so slain by a vampire will arise the next night as a vampire enslaved to the <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> who made him. Others so slain arise instead as <a href="#ghouls">ghouls</a>. Vampires are destroyed only by direct sunlight, immersion in running water, or a wooden stake through the heart. They can be held at bay by a strongly presented Cross, the smell of fresh garlic, or the face of a mirror.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="weasels-giant">Weasels, Giant</h5>
                  <p>are cunning hunters adept at moving through tunnels and crawl <a href="#space-required">spaces</a> in fierce packs. When an attack roll exceeds the number required to hit by 4 or more a <a href="#giants">giant</a> weasel bites and holds on, gorging on the victim&#8217;s blood and draining him of 1-4 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#strength">strength</a> the following <a href="#turns">turn</a> and each <a href="#turns">turn</a> thereafter, until it has sapped 1 point for each of its own <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a>. Any victim reduced to nil <a href="#strength">strength</a> is slain.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="wight-apes">Wight Apes</h5>
                  <p>are so called for their pale coloration and dread demeanor. They occur in small bands in dense jungles and around ruined catacombs. They are larger and more aggressive than regular <a href="#apes">apes</a> and have a taste for <a href="#men">man</a>-flesh. Worse yet, they possess a malign cunning employing rocks and stones as tools and their <a href="#strength">strength</a> is such that they cause 1-11 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> on a hit.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="wights">Wights</h5>
                  <p>are accursed undead that drain one experience level on a hit. They dislike <a href="#light_2">light</a> and their attack rolls and <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> checks are penalized by &#8722;2 in daylight. They are impervious to <a href="#normal-weapons">normal weaponry</a> unless it is silvered, but magic weapons will do them double <a href="#damage">damage</a>. Any <a href="#man-types">man-type</a> slain by a wight will arise on the following night as a wight.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="wolves">Wolves</h5>
                  <p>occur primarily in cold regions and hunt in packs.</p>

                  <p>includes dire <a href="#wolves">wolves</a> and wargs, both being larger than their <a href="#normal-types">normal</a> kin. Wargs are especially cunning and evil and are 20% likely to speak the common tongue and always speak the chaotic tongue. They can be ridden by <a href="#goblins">goblins</a> although this will reduce either to 12&quot; <a href="#time-and-movement_2">movement</a> and a single attack roll each <a href="#turns">turn</a> even versus <a href="#normal-types">normal-types</a>.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="woolly-mammoths">Woolly Mammoths</h5>
                  <p>are enormous, hairy, elephant-like mammals that occur in herds in arctic regions. They are more aggressive than <a href="#mastodons">mastodons</a> and are invulnerable to cold. They cause 3-18 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> by charging, trampling, crushing, or goring with their mighty tusks.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="woolly-rhinoceroses">Woolly Rhinoceroses</h5>
                  <p>are enormous, hairy, rhinoceros-like mammals that occur in arctic regions. They have poor eyesight but excellent hearing and are inclined to attack anything that approaches or spooks them. They are invulnerable to cold and cause 4-14 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> by charging, trampling, or crushing.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="wraiths">Wraiths</h5>
                  <p>are dreadful undead that exist more in the spirit <a href="#creating-a-world">world</a> and less in the physical. They dislike <a href="#light_2">light</a> and their attack rolls and <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> checks are penalized by &#8722;2 in daylight. <a href="#normal-types">Normal</a> <a href="#man-types">man-types</a> must check <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> immediately if attacked by a wraith, while evil sorts fighting alongside one receive +1 on their <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a>. They drain one experience level on a hit. They are impervious to <a href="#normal-weapons">normal weaponry</a> unless it is silvered, although silver weapons will do them only half <a href="#damage">damage</a>.

                  <p>When a <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> lair is discovered it will contain the <a href="#monsters_2">monsters&#8217;</a> <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> hoard (if any) according to its stated <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> type. The referee should <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> for each category of <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> (copper, silver, gold, etc.) separately, firstly checking to determine if the category of <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> is present in the hoard and secondly, if it is present, to determine quantity.</p>
                  <p>The percentage figures are the chance that the category will be present and the range figures are quantites. For example, <a href="#orcs">orcs</a> have <a href="#treasure-types">treasure type</a> C so there is a 17% chance their lair will contain 1,000-12,000 cp, a 33% chance their lair will contain 1,000-4,000 sp, a 33% chance their lair will contain 1-4 gems, a 33% chance their lair will contain 1 piece of jewelry, and a 17% chance their lair will contain 2 items from the &#8220;Any <a href="#treasures">Treasures</a>&#8221; table.</p>

                  <p>Maps reveal the location of a <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> trove which may contain valuables, or magic items, or both. A map will indicate the type and approximate worth of the <a href="#treasures">treasure</a>, which can be determined randomly or by the referee.

                  <p>Employable by <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-users</a> only, these provide vision of a desired place, person, or object.

                  <h5 id="helm-of-alignment-change">Helm of Alignment Change</h5>
                  <p>If worn, this <a href="#magical-helms">helm</a> immediately causes lawful persons to become chaotic and vice versa. Neutral persons are 50% likely to change either way.

                  <p>This <a href="#magical-helms">helm</a> enables the wearer to probe subjects within 9&quot; in exactly the same manner as the <a href="#sixth-sense">sixth sense</a> spell. Additionally, the wearer can implant a mental suggestion in any intelligent subject so sensed. If a suggestion is attempted the referee throws a <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">reaction</a> check for the subject, adjusting the result by +2. A positive or better <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">reaction</a> indicates that the subject will enact any reasonable (according to his <a href="#alignment">alignment</a>) suggestion.</p>

                  <h5 id="helm-of-teleportation">Helm of Teleportation</h5>
                  <p>This <a href="#magical-helms">helm</a> grants <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-users</a> only the ability to <a href="#teleportation">teleport</a> up to three times per day as per the <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> spell. If the <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> also has the <a href="#teleportation">teleport</a> spell memorized that spell will not be erased from memory when <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">cast</a> for so long as this <a href="#magical-helms">helm</a> is worn.</p>

                  <h5 id="horn-of-blasting">Horn of Blasting</h5>
                  <p>A blast upon this great horn delivers 2-12 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> to all living things within a cone-shaped area of effect 10&quot; long and up to 3&quot; wide.

                  <p>A <a href="#armor-and-shields">shield</a>-sized mirror that <a href="#tricks-and-traps">traps</a> any <a href="#man-types">man-type</a> or undead who sees his own reflection at 1&quot; or closer. It is 90% likely that an unwary subject will see his reflection in good <a href="#light_2">light</a>, but only 10% likely if he is wary of the mirror&#8217;s power. A <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> can gaze into a mirror safely with a secret command word or the use of a <a href="#gazeback">gazeback</a> spell. The mirror can contain 15-20 prisoners at one time with each being held individually in a private null dimension. Those so imprisoned remain unharmed but are completely powerless therein. A <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> can call any prisoner to the surface of the mirror to converse, and if desired, can free them from the mirror. Breaking the mirror will free all prisoners simultaneously.</p>

The conjuration requires a full <a href="#turns">turn</a> of preparation and another of invocation. The <a href="#elementals">elemental</a> brought forth will then have 12 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a> and be subject to the <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user&#8217;s</a> will exactly as per the <a href="#invoke-elemental">invoke elemental</a> spell.</p>

A result of 2-6 indicates a non-intelligent sword much like other magical weaponry. A result of 7 or more indicates an intelligent sword with the possibility of additional <a href="#powers">powers</a>.</p>

                  <div id="table3_29"></div>
                  <p>Dicing 6 or less indicates a regular magic weapon. Dicing 7 or more indicates an intelligent, living thing with its own motivations and personality.

                  <h4 id="communication">Communication</h4>
                  <p>An intelligent sword is able to communicate. Empathic communication is via physical hints such as pointing, leaning, shaking, and vibrating. Verbal communication is via an audible voice spoken in any <a href="#many-languages">language</a> the sword knows. An intelligent sword capable of verbal communication will always know its <a href="#alignment">alignment</a> tongue and a number of additional <a href="#many-languages">languages</a> determined by two six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a>.</p>
                  <div id="table3_30"></div>

                  <p>All intelligent <a href="#magic-swords">magic swords</a> are either lawful, neutral, or chaotic. A <a href="#holy">holy</a> sword is always lawful, an <a href="#unholy">unholy</a> sword is always chaotic, and a <a href="#vorpal">vorpal</a> sword is always neutral, regardless of its <a href="#intelligence_1">intelligence</a>.</p>

For example, a lawful player will suffer 2-12 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> if he handles a chaotic sword.

                  <h4 id="ego">Ego</h4>
                  <p>All intelligent swords have an ego. The higher a sword&#8217;s ego the more challenging it will be to master. A sword&#8217;s ego rating is determined by throwing two six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> and adjusting the result by +1 for each additional <a href="#many-languages">language</a> or <a href="#powers">power</a> the sword possesses (whichever is greater).</p>
                  
                  <h4 id="powers">Powers</h4>
                  <p>Intelligent swords will possess a number of additional powers and exceptional powers. The referee should roll on the <a href="#magic-swords">Magic Sword</a> Powers table and, if necessary, the <a href="#magic-swords">Magic Sword</a> Exceptional Powers table to determine each of these functions.</p>
                  <div id="table3_32"></div>
                  <div id="table3_33"></div>
                  <p>The wielder is required to hold the sword unsheathed and to concentrate for a <a href="#turns">turn</a> in order to invoke any of these powers. Only a single power may be used each <a href="#turns">turn</a> but they can otherwise be used thrice per day, with the exception of regeneration (which is continuous) and <a href="#wishes">wishes</a> (which can be used a total of 3 or 1-6 times).</p>
                  <p>Unless noted otherwise, these powers are as the equivalent <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a>.</p>
                  <p>A sword with the life stealing power can invoke a finger of death once per day and is always chaotic. If it is a <a href="#holy">holy</a> or <a href="#vorpal">vorpal</a> sword it is declared an <a href="#unholy">unholy</a> sword instead.</p>

                  <h4 id="purpose">Purpose</h4>
                  <p>The most potent <a href="#magic-swords">magic swords</a> have been forged for a specific purpose.Should a sword have both 9 or more <a href="#intelligence_1">intelligence</a> and 9 or more <a href="#ego">ego</a> it is a purposed sword. It will have the maximum <a href="#intelligence_1">intelligence</a> and <a href="#ego">ego</a>&#8212;promote both to 12 but do not add <a href="#powers">powers</a> if <a href="#intelligence_1">intelligence</a> is raised.</p>
                  <p>The purpose of such a sword is determined by dicing on the <a href="#magic-swords">Magic Sword</a> Purpose table.</p>
                  <div id="table3_34"></div>
                  <p>In all cases the purpose of a sword is according to its <a href="#alignment">alignment</a>. Thus, a lawful sword purposed to destroy <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-users</a> is purposed to destroy chaotic <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-users</a> only. A neutral purposed sword affects lawful and chaotic types equally.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A lawful sword will paralyze a purposed foe on a successful hit if he fails to save <a href="#paralysis-and-petrification">versus petrification</a>.</li>
                    <li>A neutral sword will <a href="#feeblemind">feeblemind</a> a purposed foe on a successful hit if he fails to save <a href="#spell">versus spells</a>. Use confused behaviour if already in <a href="#combat">combat</a>.</li>

                  <h4 id="dominance">Dominance</h4>
                  <p>An intelligent sword also has a dominance rating which is the sum of its <a href="#intelligence_1">intelligence</a> and <a href="#ego">ego</a>.</p>
                  <p>A sword may mentally wrestle for dominance over its wielder in order to get its own way when any of the following (or similar) circumstances arise:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Any character willingly draws or even touches the sword,</li>
                    <li>The sword&#8217;s <a href="#purpose">purposed</a> enemy appears,</li>
                    <li>Another magical sword is found,</li>
                    <li>The wielder is reduced to fewer than half of his <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a>.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Compare the sword&#8217;s dominance to the sum of the player character&#8217;s <a href="#wisdom">wisdom</a>, <a href="#charisma">charisma</a>, and <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-man</a> level. The player character adds 1-6 if he is fresh and uninjured but subtracts 1-6 if he has fewer than half of his total possible <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a>. The sword adds 2-12 if its <a href="#alignment">alignment</a> differs from the player character&#8217;s.</p>
                  <p>If there is any difference in the sword&#8217;s favor it gains control over the character unless he makes a successful <a href="#saving-throws">saving throw</a> <a href="#spell">versus spells</a>. If the difference is 6 or more no <a href="#saving-throws">saving throw</a> is allowed.</p>
                  <p>Whenever a sword dominates its wielder it causes him to act in accordance with its own goals. This means disposing of competing weapons, entering into glorious (or ignoble) <a href="#combat">combat</a>, decorating itself with bejeweled hilt-work or scabbards, surrendering itself to a superior wielder who can better achieve its goals (or an inferior one whom it can more easily dominate), or any other actions that serve its own end. Domination is usually exerted for the duration of one such action.</p>
                  
                  <h2 id="afterword">Afterword</h2>
                  <p>Much has been written down and accounted for, but all the words in this book are merely a foundation for what will ultimately be a fantasy game <a href="#the-campaign">campaign</a> of the referee&#8217;s own devising. He is encouraged to create liberally and enthusiastically and to welcome input from his players. Their choices and actions should <a href="#rings">ring</a> true in the game <a href="#creating-a-world">world</a> so that it thrives and invites further participation. With a living game in motion the referee can derive considerable enjoyment from extending or altering the rules to meet his own particular needs. In this case the referee is cautioned to do so judiciously and with consistency.</p>
                  <p>Above all, referees and players alike are reminded that this is a game and that games are meant to be fun.</p>
                  <p>Fight On!</p>
