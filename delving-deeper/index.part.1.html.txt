                <div class="section-i-contents">
                  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                  <p>Delving Deeper is a gateway to realms where magic works and <a href="#dragons">dragons</a> are real, where <a href="#elves_1">elves</a> and <a href="#dwarfs_1">dwarfs</a> fight alongside <a href="#men">men</a> against <a href="#goblins">goblins</a> and <a href="#giants">giants</a>, and where a strong sword arm can carry the day in battle. All that is needed to play is some basic stationery, a few friends, and a vivid imagination.</p>
                  <p>One player will referee the fantasy <a href="#creating-a-world">world</a> while the others assume the role of adventurers and explore it. As heroes and wizards they will face its challenges, defeating <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> and winning fabulous <a href="#treasures">treasures</a> as they rise to fame or, if they are careless, vanish into obscurity.</p>
                  <h3 id="about-these-rules">About These Rules</h3>
                  <p>Players should begin with <a href="#section-i-heroes-and-magic">Section I</a> which details characters that can be played, <a href="#equipment">equipment</a> and <a href="#hirelings">hirelings</a> that can be had, and <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> that are available to magic-using sorts. Players need read no further.</p>
                  <p>Aspiring referees are advised to continue immediately on to <a href="#section-ii-delving-and-exploration">Section II</a> wherein are guidelines for constructing a <a href="#creating-a-world">campaign world</a> and filling it with <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeons</a>, <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a>, and <a href="#treasures">treasures</a>, and advice on conducting adventures around these. Finally, <a href="#section-iii-monsters-and-treasures">Section III</a> is intended as a reference for referees; it contains all manner of <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a>&#8212;from <a href="#androids">androids</a> to <a href="#zombies">zombies</a>&#8212;and <a href="#treasures">treasures</a> including magical <a href="#staves-and-wands">wands</a>, weapons, and a plethora of other items.</p>
                  <h3 id="common-terms">Common Terms</h3>
                  <p>Delving Deeper is a role-playing game in which the players control player characters (PCs) and the referee controls non-player characters (NPCs) including <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a>. All these have a number of <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a> (HD) which are six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> thrown to see how many <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit points</a> (hp) can be sustained before being slain. <a href="#melee">Armor class</a> (AC) is a measure of protection against physical attack, while <a href="#saving-throws">saving throws</a> are made to avert fates such as <a href="#poison_1">poisoning</a>, being turned to stone, or being vaporized by <a href="#dragon-breath-weapon">dragon&#8217;s breath</a>. Player characters accumulate <a href="#experience-points">experience points</a> (XP) in order to advance to each successive level of <a href="#explanation-of-abilities">ability</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="distances-ranges-and-movement-rates" class="common-term">
                    Distances, <br>
                    Ranges, and <br>
                    Movement Rates
                  </h5>
                  <p>Distances, Ranges, and Movement Rates are given as inches. An inch represents a real <a href="#encounter-distance_3">distance</a> according to the <a href="#scale">scale</a> of play. At the <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a> <a href="#scale">scale</a> 1&quot; represents 10 feet. At the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a> <a href="#scale">scale</a> 1&quot; represents 10 yards. At the overland and ocean exploration <a href="#scale">scale</a> 1&quot; of <a href="#time-and-movement_2">movement</a> represents 1 mile per day.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="dungeon-level" class="common-term">Dungeon Level</h5>
                  <p>Dungeon Level pertains to depth underground. The 1st <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level is the shallowest, the 2nd <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level is the next deeper level, and so on. Deeper <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> levels are more dangerous and more rewarding than shallower <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> levels. Players will usually determine what <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level they wish to explore.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="experience-level" class="common-term">Experience Level</h5>
                  <p>Experience Level ranks the relative power of player characters. Players begin at the 1st (least powerful) experience level and work their way upward. While experience levels are theoretically unlimited these rules assume the majority of play will occur at the 1st through 12th experience levels.</p>
                  <h5 id="gold-pieces" class="common-term">Gold Pieces</h5>
                  <p>Gold Pieces (gp) are the basic unit of currency for which goods are traded. One gold piece is worth 10 silver pieces or 100 copper pieces. There are 20 coins of any type to one pound.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="heroic-types" class="common-term">Heroic-Types</h5>
                  <p>Heroic-Types include all <a href="#man-types">man-types</a> of heroic stature and all <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> that represent a heroic threat. Collectively these are all creatures with 3 or more <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a> but fewer than 7 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="man-types" class="common-term">Man-Types</h5>
                  <p>Man-Types are all <a href="#men">men</a> and other creatures of same basic proportions including <a href="#androids">androids</a>, <a href="#cavemen">cavemen</a>, <a href="#dwarfs_1">dwarfs</a>, <a href="#elves_1">elves</a>, <a href="#gnolls">gnolls</a>, <a href="#gnomes">gnomes</a>, <a href="#goblins">goblins</a>, <a href="#halflings_1">halflings</a>, <a href="#hobgoblins">hobgoblins</a>, <a href="#kobolds">kobolds</a>, <a href="#lizardmen">lizardmen</a>, <a href="#mermen">mermen</a>, <a href="#nixies">nixies</a>, <a href="#orcs">orcs</a>, and <a href="#pixies">pixies</a>. The majority of <a href="#men">man</a>-types are also <a href="#normal-types">normal-types</a> but exceptional individuals can be <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a>- or <a href="#superheroic-types">superheroic-types</a> instead.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="monsters" class="common-term">Monsters</h5>
                  <p>Monsters are all creatures controlled by the referee. These include <a href="#dragons">dragons</a>, <a href="#orcs">orcs</a>, <a href="#vampires">vampires</a>, and other genuine horrors of the <a href="#underworld-exploration">underworld</a> as well as the townsfolk, <a href="#hirelings">hirelings</a>, and even non-player heroes of the game <a href="#creating-a-world">world</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="a-morale-check" class="common-term">Morale Check</h5>
                  <p>A Morale Check is a throw of two six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> used by the referee to determine the behavior of <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> (including <a href="#man-types">man-types</a>) in potentially life-threatening circumstances, particularly in <a href="#combat">combat</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="normal-missiles" class="common-term">Normal-Missiles</h5>
                  <p>Normal-Missiles are all non-magical projectiles including <a href="#spears">spears</a>, stones, <a href="#arrows-and-bolts">arrows</a>, and <a href="#arrows-and-bolts">bolts</a> loosed by <a href="#normal-types">normal</a> <a href="#man-types">man-types</a>. An otherwise normal missile loosed by a <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a>/<a href="#superheroic-types">superheroic-type</a> is considered <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="normal-types" class="common-term">Normal-Types</h5>
                  <p>Normal-Types include all <a href="#man-types">man-types</a> of less than <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a> status and all other creatures of similar stature. Collectively these are all creatures with fewer than 3 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="normal-weapons" class="common-term">Normal-Weapons</h5>
                  <p>Normal-Weapons are all non-magical arms including swords, <a href="#spears">spears</a>, <a href="#axes">axes</a>, and <a href="#flails-and-maces">maces</a> wielded by <a href="#normal-types">normal</a> <a href="#man-types">man-types</a>. An otherwise normal weapon wielded by a <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a>/<a href="#superheroic-types">superheroic-type</a> is considered <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="a-reaction-check" class="common-term">Reaction Check</h5>
                  <p>A Reaction Check is a throw of two six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> used by the referee to determine how <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> (including <a href="#man-types">man-types</a>) will <a href="#monster-reaction">react</a> to the players, particularly upon their first meeting and in negotiations.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="a-saving-throw" class="common-term">Saving Throw</h5>
                  <p>A Saving Throw is a throw of a single twenty-sided die used by the player to avert a potentially life-threatening calamity such as being <a href="#poison_1">poisoned</a>, turned to stone, or vaporized by a <a href="#dragons">dragon&#8217;s</a> <a href="#breath-weapon">breath weapon</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="superheroic-types" class="common-term">Superheroic-Types</h5>
                  <p>Superheroic-Types include all <a href="#man-types">man-types</a> of superheroic stature and all <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> that represent a superheroic threat. Collectively these are all creatures with 7 or more <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit dice</a>.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="a-survival-check" class="common-term">Survival Check</h5>
                  <p>A Survival Check is a throw of a hundred-sided die used by the player or referee to determine whether a character or <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> will survive being raised from the dead, <a href="#baleful-polymorph">polymorphed</a> into another shape, or restored to flesh after being turned to stone.</p>
            
                  <h5 id="turns" class="common-term">Turns</h5>
                  <p>Turns are any period during which a player chooses an action for his character. At the <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> and <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a> <a href="#scale">scales</a> a turn represents one minute. At the <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> exploration <a href="#scale">scale</a> a turn represents ten minutes. At the <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> exploration <a href="#scale">scale</a> a turn represents one day.</p>
            
            
                  <h3 id="players-supplies">Player&#8217;s Supplies</h3>
                  <p>The supplies essential for play are detailed below, followed by optional extras which a player may desire. The essentials are all readily available and inexpensive (or free); even polyhedral <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> are easily obtained at hobby stores and online.</p>
                  <p><strong>The Essentials:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Delving Deeper (you have it!),</li>
                    <li><a href="#the-dice_1">Dice</a> (three six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> and one twenty-sided die per player),</li>
                    <li>Stationery (pencil, eraser, paper, and notebook),</li>
                    <li>A vivid imagination!</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Optional Extras:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>A Delving Deeper player character record sheet,</li>
                    <li>Graph paper for mapping <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeons</a>,</li>
                    <li>Hexagonal paper for mapping <a href="#wilderness-exploration">wilderness</a> regions,</li>
                    <li>Additional <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> (any number of six-sided and twenty-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> with the latter optionally marked 0-9 twice),</li>
                    <li>Miniatures to represent the player character and his entourage,</li>
                    <li>An enterprising plan...</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h4 id="the-dice">The Dice</h4>
                  <p>Delving Deeper players require six- and twenty-sided dice. A few will do but play will be quicker with half a dozen (or more) of each. For a genuine retro feel twenty-sided dice can be marked 0-9 twice, with 0 representing ten and one of the two 0-9 series being identified as adding ten.</p>
                  
                  <h3 id="preparation-for-play">Preparation for Play</h3>
                  <p>A player should initially learn something about the <a href="#creating-a-world">campaign world</a> from the referee. This information may be sketchy or generous depending on how prepared the referee is and how many players have come before. In either case it is the player&#8217;s role to insert his new character into the fantasy <a href="#creating-a-world">world</a> and augment it with his presence. Whether he comes to riches or ruin, each character should be noted!</p>
                  <p>Before choosing a character the player should familiarize himself with the options presented herein. He may desire to play a certain type of character from the outset but should be equally prepared to go with whatever the <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> may bring.</p>
                  <p>If the <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> occasionally seem unkind the player is reminded that great enjoyment can arise from unconventional characters and from dramatic demises. Such will be the fate of many adventurers.</p>
                  <p>The player should be ready to participate in the game, tackling the challenges presented with creativity and imagination&#8212;this is the greater part of the game. Above all the player must be prepared to accept the rulings of the referee and to enjoy whatever game circumstances may arise.</p>
                  <p>The adventure begins... Now!</p>
                  
                  
                  <h2 id="player-characters">Player Characters</h2>
                  <p>Having learned something about the <a href="#creating-a-world">campaign world</a> from the referee, the player&#8217;s first order of business is to construct a fantasy persona called a character. The player will thereafter control this character&#8217;s actions in the game.</p>
                  <h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
                  <p>Each character must choose a side in the eternal struggle. He is either of law or of chaos or is otherwise neutral.</p>
                  <p>Law is civility and order and upholds the greater good. Chaos is anarchy and brutality and undermines the greater good. Neutrality is neither for law nor chaos but for the individual and for those with no stake in the grander contest.</p>
                  <h3 id="determination-of-abilities">Determination of Abilities</h3>
                  <p>Characters are ranked in six <a href="#explanation-of-abilities">abilities</a>: <a href="#strength">strength</a>, <a href="#intelligence">intelligence</a>, <a href="#wisdom">wisdom</a>, <a href="#dexterity">dexterity</a>, <a href="#constitution">constitution</a>, and <a href="#charisma">charisma</a>. Each is determined, in order, by the referee with a throw of three six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> producing scores between 3 and 18. The player should record these figures on a character sheet or note paper before selecting his <a href="#classes">class</a>.</p>
                  <h3 id="prime-requisite-abilities">Prime Requisite Abilities</h3>
                  <p>One of the six <a href="#explanation-of-abilities">abilities</a> is considered to be the prime requisite for each <a href="#classes">class</a> of character. <a href="#the-fighting-man">Fighting-men</a> should be strong, <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-users</a> should be intelligent, and <a href="#the-cleric">clerics</a> should be wise.</p>
                  <p>A character will acquire a greater or lesser number of <a href="#experience-points">experience points</a> from his adventures according to his prime requisite <a href="#explanation-of-abilities">ability</a> score.</p>
                  
                  <div id="table1_1"></div>
                  
                  <p>While a high score may predispose a player toward a particular <a href="#classes">class</a> and a low score may dissuade him, <a href="#explanation-of-abilities">ability</a> scores do not preclude the selection of any <a href="#classes">class</a>. Nor do they determine a character&#8217;s success (player strategy being paramount in that).</p>
                  <p>Suppose, for example, an intending player was given these <a href="#explanation-of-abilities">ability</a> scores:</p>
                  <div id="table1_x"></div>
                  <p>With a <a href="#wisdom">wisdom</a> score of 6 this character would advance slowly as a <a href="#the-cleric">cleric</a>. His keen <a href="#intelligence">intelligence</a> means he could do well as a <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a>; however, because of a preconceived inclination toward <a href="#heroic-types">heroic</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a>, the player elects the role of a <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-man</a>. His <a href="#strength">strength</a> of 11 is perfectly respectable and his <a href="#constitution">constitution</a> of 12 indicates good fitness. A <a href="#dexterity">dexterity</a> score of 10 is neither quick nor slow, but his ordinary <a href="#charisma">charisma</a> score means this player should not depend overly on the <a href="#retainer-loyalty">loyalty</a> of his followers.</p>
                  <h3 id="explanation-of-abilities">Explanation of Abilities</h3>
                  <p>Following is an explanation of each of the six abilities.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="strength">Strength</h5>
                  <p>is raw physical power. It is useful for forcing <a href="#doors">doors</a>, lifting gates, and carrying heavy <a href="#equipment">equipment</a> including <a href="#treasures">treasure</a>! Strength is the <a href="#prime-requisite-abilities">prime requisite</a> for <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a>.</p>
                  <div id="table1_2"></div>
                  
                  <h5 id="movement-rates">Movement Rates</h5>
                  <p>allowed by load are for <a href="#men">man</a>-sized and <a href="#men">man</a>-like types. These should be scaled appropriately for other types but any character reduced to half his <a href="#time-and-movement_2">movement</a> rate is considered to be encumbered. <a href="#time-and-movement_2">Movement</a> rates are expressed in inches which are scaled according to the environment being explored to produce the actual ground rate.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="intelligence">Intelligence</h5>
                  <p>is cunning, acumen, and book learning and one additional <a href="#many-languages">language</a> is known for every point beyond 10. Intelligence is the <a href="#prime-requisite-abilities">prime requisite</a> for <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-users</a> and is useful to the referee for determining what course of action a non-player character should take.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="many-languages">Many Languages</h5>
                  <p>are spoken throughout the game <a href="#creating-a-world">world</a> with each intelligent type having its own tongue. <a href="#man-types">Man-types</a> also share a &#8220;common tongue&#8221; which 20% of all speaking creatures will know.</p>
                  <div id="table1_3"></div>
                  <p>Additionally, there are the tongues of law, chaos, and neutrality which are known to the speaking membership of those <a href="#alignment">alignments</a>. Creatures of one <a href="#alignment">alignment</a> will recognize the other <a href="#alignment">alignment</a> tongues without comprehending them. Chaotics will attack speakers of law and vice versa.</p>
                  <p>Player characters always know at least two languages: the common tongue and an <a href="#alignment">alignment</a> tongue. Non-human player characters may know additional languages as will all characters with above average <a href="#intelligence">intelligence</a>. Additionally, there are <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> and magic items that will aid in the comprehension of unknown languages.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="wisdom">Wisdom</h5>
                  <p>is intuition, common sense, and maturity. Each 2 points of wisdom beyond 10 will add 1 point to the character&#8217;s <a href="#prime-requisite-abilities">prime requisite</a> for the purpose of calculating <a href="#experience-points">experience points</a> earned. Wisdom is the <a href="#prime-requisite-abilities">prime requisite</a> for <a href="#the-cleric">clerics</a> and functions as does <a href="#intelligence">intelligence</a> in determining what course of action a non-player character should take.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="dexterity">Dexterity</h5>
                  <p>is reaction speed, coordination, and agility. It is useful for accurate shooting and for quick reflexes when <a href="#initiative">initiative</a> is in question. Dexterity is the <a href="#prime-requisite-abilities">prime requisite</a> for <a href="#the-thief-optional-class">thieves</a> (if these are used).</p>
                  <div id="table1_4"></div>
                  
                  <h5 id="constitution">Constitution</h5>
                  <p>is vim, fitness, and toughness. It determines what <a href="#damage">damage</a> can be endured and whether or not a character can withstand being raised from the dead, <a href="#baleful-polymorph">polymorphed</a>, or petrified.</p>
                  <div id="table1_5"></div>
                  
                  <h5 id="shock-survival">Shock Survival</h5>
                  <p>is the probability that a character will survive the greatest physical ordeals. This check is required to be raised from the dead (any failed attempt indicates that no subsequent attempt can ever succeed), to survive returning to flesh after being turned to stone, and to survive transformation into another shape by the <a href="#baleful-polymorph">baleful polymorph</a> spell.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="charisma">Charisma</h5>
                  <p>is comeliness, personal charm, and social influence. It is useful in determining <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">reactions</a>, in negotiations, and for attracting <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> into service. It determines the number of <a href="#retainers">retainers</a> a character can have and the <a href="#retainer-loyalty">loyalty</a> of any <a href="#hirelings">hirelings</a>.</p>
                  <div id="table1_6"></div>
                  
                  
                  <h3 id="classes">Classes</h3>
                  <p>Having been given <a href="#explanation-of-abilities">ability</a> scores the player must select a class. Characters begin at the 1st level in the chosen class and thereafter advance to successive experience levels by returning to a safe haven after accumulating the necessary number of <a href="#experience-points">experience points</a>.</p>
                  <h5 id="the-numbers-of-hit-dice">The numbers of hit dice</h5>
                  <p>given on the following charts are always six-sided and are thrown to determine the number of hit points of <a href="#damage">damage</a> that can be sustained before death. Hit <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> are thrown and summed with any additions being added to the total.</p>
                  <p>The figures given for each <a href="#saving-throws">saving throw</a> category are those required on a twenty-sided die to avert various calamities.</p>
                  
                  <h5 id="experience-points">Experience Points</h5>
                  <p>(XP) are earned primarily by recovering (not merely finding) <a href="#treasures">treasure</a>. 1 XP is awarded per gold piece worth of <a href="#treasures">treasure</a> recovered though the division of any such riches, and hence any XP, is entirely up to the players.</p>
                  <p>Experience points are also earned by defeating <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a>. 100 XP are awarded for each <a href="#hit-dice">hit die</a> of each enemy defeated. The referee may increase the base award for especially dangerous enemies including those with <a href="#poison">poisonous</a>, paralyzing, or multiple attacks.</p>
                  <p>Experience awards for defeating <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> are scaled according to the ratio of the <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level to the character level so that higher level players are encouraged to seek appropriate challenges. If a party of 1st level characters were to defeat a dozen 1 HD <a href="#orcs">orcs</a> on the 1st <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level they would be awarded 1,200 XP between them. If a party of 6th level characters defeated the same <a href="#orcs">orcs</a> they would earn one-sixth as many XP because they are 6th level characters exploring the 1st <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> level.</p>
                  <p>Note that no character can advance more than a single experience level in a single adventure. He will always fall at least 1 XP short of gaining a second experience level with any excess XP discarded.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h3 id="the-cleric">The Cleric</h3>
                  <p>Clerics must choose law or chaos; they cannot remain neutral in the eternal struggle. Either type must remain steadfast in this choice or be stripped of his status.</p>
                  <p>Clerics of the lawful sort are virtuous knights and templars whose purpose is to vanquish evil. Their conviction in the righteousness of this mission enables them to <a href="#turning-the-undead">turn the undead</a> and to invoke miracles. In performing their duty clerics are allowed <a href="#armor-and-shields">shields</a> and any <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a> but the use of edged or piercing weapons is forbidden.</p>
                  <div id="table1_8"></div>
                  <p>A cleric begins play with a <a href="#spell-books">spell book</a> containing the 1st level <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> and can thereafter <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">cast</a> a number of <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> each day appropriate for his experience level. So long as he adheres to his faith a cleric will gain access to <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> of successive spell levels as he advances in experience, and can devise <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> of his own besides.</p>
                  <div id="table1_7"></div>
                  <p>When a cleric achieves 9th level he can establish a <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> and the religious fervor of the workforce will reduce any construction costs by half. Once established, a <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> will attract a body of 50-300 fanatically loyal <a href="#men-dervishes">dervishes</a> who will serve without payment (the referee will determine the exact composition of this force). If the surrounding countryside is kept clear of <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> this holding will attract faithful settlers each of whom can pay 2 gp in tithes and taxes per month.</p>
                  <h4 id="turning-the-undead">Turning the Undead</h4>
                  <p>Mindless undead need never check <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> and cannot be <a href="#attacking-to-subdue">subdued</a> but all the undead are subject to being turned away&#8212;or even destroyed
                    utterly&#8212;by a faithful cleric who forcefully presents a Cross. Turning the undead is accomplished by throwing two six-sided <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> and comparing the result to the following table.</p>
                  <div id="table1_9"></div>
                  <p>Should a cleric fail to turn an undead <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> he cannot attempt to turn that <a href="#monsters_2">monster</a> again until sunrise.</p>
                  <h4 id="the-anti-cleric">The Anti-Cleric</h4>
                  <p>Clerics of the chaotic sort are called anti-clerics. They are intended as villains and their purpose is to vanquish good. They cannot <a href="#turning-the-undead">turn the undead</a> but have a selection of reversed clerical <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> which they can employ with impunity. Otherwise, they function as do <a href="#the-cleric">clerics</a> except that an anti-cleric <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> will attract <a href="#men-zealots">zealots</a> rather than <a href="#men-dervishes">dervishes</a>.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h3 id="the-fighting-man">The Fighting-man</h3>
                  <p>Fighting-men are soldiers, champions, and other warriors who engage in toe-to-toe and <a href="#missile-fire">missile</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a>. Of all the <a href="#classes">classes</a> they are the most formidable in attack and can withstand the most <a href="#damage">damage</a>. A fighting-man has the use of any <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a> or <a href="#armor-and-shields">shield</a> and all weaponry, including <a href="#missile-fire">missiles</a> and <a href="#spears">spears</a>. Moreover, <a href="#magic-swords">magic swords</a> and the majority of other enchanted weapons are usable exclusively by them.</p>
                  <div id="table1_10"></div>
                  <p>In <a href="#melee_2">melee</a> <a href="#combat">combat</a> versus <a href="#normal-types">normal-types</a> a fighting-man throws one attack roll as a 1st level fighting-man for each of his own <a href="#hit-dice">hit die</a>. Starting at 4th level he adds +1 to <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> checks of any troops he leads in <a href="#combat">combat</a>, and he will not be targeted by <a href="#normal-types">normal-types</a> while there are <a href="#normal-types">normal</a> targets available.</p>
                  <p>At 8th level and above a fighting-man is aware of invisible opponents within 3&quot; and <a href="#normal-types">normal-types</a> require a positive <a href="#reaction-and-morale-checks">morale</a> check to stand their ground if he charges them. He is unable to <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">cast</a> <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a>, however, and has a limited selection of other magical items.</p>
                  <p>When a fighting-man achieves 9th level he can establish a <a href="#strongholds">stronghold</a> and declare himself its Lord. If the surrounding countryside is kept clear of <a href="#monsters_2">monsters</a> this holding will attract settlers each of whom can pay 1 gp in taxes per month.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h3 id="the-magic-user">The Magic-User</h3>
                  <p>Magic-users are potentially the most powerful <a href="#classes">class</a> but they are also the most vulnerable; they can wear no <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a> and can use only <a href="#daggers">daggers</a> and <a href="#staves-and-wands">staves</a> as weapons. A magic-user can, however, <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">cast</a> magic <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a>. He begins play with a <a href="#spell-books">spell book</a> containing the 1st level <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> and can <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">cast</a> a number of <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> from memory each day appropriate for his experience level. He gains access to <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> of successive spell levels as he advances in experience, and can devise his own <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> besides.</p>
                  <p>A magic-user has use of the greatest selection of enchanted items. All save for arms (other than <a href="#daggers">daggers</a> and <a href="#staves-and-wands">staves</a>), <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a>, and a handful of clerical items are at his disposal. Should these prove insufficient a magic-user of at least 9th level can <a href="#enchanting-magic-items">enchant</a> items of his own. The cost and time required to <a href="#enchanting-magic-items">enchant</a> an item will be commensurate with its value.</p>
                  <div id="table1_11"></div>
                  <div id="table1_12"></div>
                  
                  
                  <h5 id="halflings">Halflings</h5>
                  <p>can be <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a> but are limited to 4th level. They are deadly accurate with hurled <a href="#missile-fire">missiles</a> adjusting attack rolls by +3, and will identify noises when <a href="#listening">listening</a> at <a href="#doors">doors</a> with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die. They are nearly invisible when they blend into the background and can <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a> almost silently. Despite their diminutive stature halflings are surprisingly resilient and make all <a href="#saving-throws">saving throws</a> at four levels higher than their actual level.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h5 id="dwarfs">Dwarfs</h5>
                  <p>dwell underground and see equally well by day or by night. They are limited to 6th level as <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a> but make all <a href="#saving-throws">saving throws</a> at four levels above their actual level and are the only characters able to employ the +3 <a href="#war-hammers">war hammer</a> to its full potential. They are adept at evading large, clumsy enemies and suffer only half <a href="#damage">damage</a> from foes such as <a href="#ogres">ogres</a> and <a href="#giants">giants</a>.</p>
                  <p>Dwarfs are expert miners and are able to note any new constructions, <a href="#shifting-walls">shifting walls</a>, slopes, falling slabs, false floors and the like in <a href="#populating-a-dungeon">dungeon</a> stonework. They will identify noises when <a href="#listening">listening</a> at <a href="#doors">doors</a> with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die.</p>
                  <p>Dwarfs are able to speak the <a href="#many-languages">languages</a> of <a href="#gnomes">gnomes</a>, <a href="#goblins">goblins</a>, and <a href="#kobolds">kobolds</a> in addition to their own <a href="#many-languages">language</a>, their <a href="#alignment">alignment</a> tongue, and the common tongue.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h5 id="elves">Elves</h5>
                  <p>begin as either <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a> or <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-users</a> but can <a href="#changing-class">change class</a> between adventures as often as desired. An elf becomes dual-classed when he changes <a href="#classes">class</a> for the first time and may thereafter use both the weaponry of a <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-man</a> and the <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> of a <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> simultaneously.</p>
                  <p>The dual-classed character must maintain separate <a href="#experience-points">experience point</a> totals for each of his <a href="#classes">classes</a>, with all earned experience going toward his currently active <a href="#classes">class</a>. He uses the more favorable game statistics of both <a href="#classes">classes</a> during play but cannot act as a <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> while wearing non-magical <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a>.</p>
                  <p>Elves deal +1 <a href="#the-numbers-of-hit-dice">hit point</a> of <a href="#damage">damage</a> when employing magic weapons and can <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a> and fire a <a href="#bows">bow</a> without penalty when on foot. They are nearly invisible in their gray-green cloaks and can <a href="#time-and-movement_2">move</a> almost silently. When actively <a href="#searching">searching</a> they will locate <a href="#secret-doors">secret doors</a> with a throw of 3-6 on a six-sided die. When merely passing by they will do so with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die. They will identify noises when <a href="#listening">listening</a> at <a href="#doors">doors</a> with a throw of 5-6 on a six-sided die and are immune to the paralyzing touch of <a href="#ghouls">ghouls</a> and <a href="#thulls">thulls</a>. They are, however, limited to 4th level as <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a> and to 8th level as <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-users</a>.</p>
                  <p>Elves are able to speak the <a href="#many-languages">languages</a> of <a href="#gnolls">gnolls</a>, <a href="#hobgoblins">hobgoblins</a>, and <a href="#orcs">orcs</a> as well as their own <a href="#many-languages">language</a>, their <a href="#alignment">alignment</a> tongue, and the common tongue.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h3 id="the-thief-optional-class">The Thief (Optional Class)</h3>
                  <p>Thieves are sneaks, trouble-shooters, and infiltrators who operate by cunning and subtlety. <a href="#men">Men</a>, <a href="#elves_1">elves</a>, <a href="#dwarfs_1">dwarfs</a>, and <a href="#halflings_1">halflings</a> can advance without limitation but because thieves are necessarily underhanded they cannot be aligned with law. <a href="#dexterity">Dexterity</a> is their <a href="#prime-requisite-abilities">prime requisite</a>.</p>
                  <p>Although able to employ <a href="#daggers">daggers</a>, slings, and <a href="#short-swords">short swords</a> thieves lack the resilience of proper <a href="#the-fighting-man">fighting-men</a> and can wear leather <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a> only. Furthermore, a thief is best suited to striking from behind with <a href="#surprise">surprise</a>. In these circumstances a +4 adjustment is applied to the attack roll and a successful attack will cause two <a href="#damage">damage</a> <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> at levels 1-4, four <a href="#damage">damage</a> <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> at levels 5-10, and six <a href="#damage">damage</a> <a href="#the-dice_1">dice</a> at levels 11-12.</p>
                  <p>This aside, a thief is especially skilled in many subterfuges including:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Opening locks and foiling of magical closures,</li>
                    <li>Disarming small trapped devices such as spring-loaded <a href="#poison_1">poisoned</a> needles,</li>
                    <li>Climbing almost sheer surfaces up or down at half normal <a href="#movement-rates_1">movement rate</a>,</li>
                    <li>Identifying noises behind closed <a href="#doors">doors</a>,</li>
                    <li>Stealing or concealing items by sleight-of-hand,</li>
                    <li>Moving stealthily to pass or <a href="#surprise">surprise</a> enemies,</li>
                    <li>Hiding in nothing more than shadows,</li>
                    <li>Finding hidden or <a href="#secret-doors">secret doors</a> and passages.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>A thief accomplishes all these with a throw of 3-6 on a six-sided die. Should he fail to disarm a <a href="#tricks-and-traps">trap</a> it will instead be sprung with all the usual consequences.</p>

                  <p>At 3rd level and above a thief is equally able to discern the meaning of any non-magical cipher, message, map, or other written instruction. At 9th level and above this ability extends to <a href="#spell-casting-from-memory">casting</a> <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> <a href="#explanation-of-spells">spells</a> from <a href="#spellbooks-and-scrolls">scrolls</a>.</p>
                  
                  
                  <h3 id="changing-class">Changing Class</h3>
                  <p>Even if the referee allows <a href="#classes">class</a> changes no character can ever change <a href="#classes">class</a> during an adventure, nor can a <a href="#the-cleric">cleric</a> ever change to a <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> or vice versa. Human characters require a minimum score of 16 in the <a href="#prime-requisite-abilities">prime requisite</a> of the <a href="#classes">class</a> they intend to change to. Non-human characters have no such requirement.</p>
                  <p>A character becomes dual-classed when he changes <a href="#classes">class</a> for the first time and thereafter enjoys the benefits of both <a href="#classes">classes</a> simultaneously. A dual-classed <a href="#the-cleric">cleric</a> is always restricted in his choice of weaponry and a dual-classed <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> (other than an <a href="#elves_1">elf</a>, who may act as a <a href="#the-magic-user">magic-user</a> while wearing magical <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a>) must always go unarmored. A dual-classed <a href="#the-thief-optional-class">thief</a> (if these are used) is always restricted to leather <a href="#armor-and-shields">armor</a>.</p>
                  <p>The player of a dual-classed character must maintain separate <a href="#experience-points">experience point</a> totals for each of his <a href="#classes">classes</a>. Experience is only ever earned toward one <a href="#classes">class</a> at a time, as elected by the player at the beginning of each adventure. A dual-classed character may change <a href="#classes">class</a> (for the purpose of allocating <a href="#experience-points">experience points</a>) at any time, subject to the aforementioned restrictions. The more favorable game statistics of his <a href="#classes">classes</a> are used during play.</p>

                  <p>The <a href="#classes">classes</a> herein will provide many challenges for beginners and experts alike but are by no means exhaustive. There is no reason why a player could not play a noble <a href="#centaurs">centaur</a>, a
                    cunning <a href="#lizardmen">lizardman</a>, or any other type of character should the referee permit it. Whatever these other <a href="#classes">classes</a> may be, the referee should ensure that they start out relatively weak
                    and have scope to advance in power as do the other <a href="#classes">classes</a>.</p>
